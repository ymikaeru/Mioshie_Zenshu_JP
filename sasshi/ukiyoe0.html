    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I have been a lover of painting since boyhood.
    It has always been a delight for me to visit exhibitions and
    collections, as well as to collect for myself. Last year I
    built a small art museum at Hakone, to exhibit art works of
    various kinds. This caused me to pay due attention to Ukiyo-e,
    in which, I must confess, previously I had not had much
    interest. Ukiyo-e aroused my enthusiasm, and the interest has
    gradually increased ever since. It offered me a source of
    delight, of a kind I had not found in other types of art, so
    much so, that I have come to regret I had not found it
    earlier.</font><font size="3"><br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">I visited last fall
    an exhibition of ukiyo-e in Kyoto, when I had the luck to be
    introduced to Mr. Ichitaro Kondo, Director of the Department
    of Education of the Tokyo National Museum. Mr. Kondo has
    since been kind enough to instruct me on Ukiyo-e, and to help
    me in my collection.</font><font size="3"><br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">My collection has
    become good enough to organize an exhibition, which, with a
    certain amount of pardonable pride, I think is a fine one,
    thanks to the invaluable assistance of Mr. Kondo. I take this
    opportunity to publish this small book, in order to call more
    interest in this peculiarly Japanese art among other parts of
    the world as well as in Japan itself. Mr. Kondo again was
    kind enough to take charge of editing it.</font></p>

        size="3" face="Arial">The history of Japanese art
        covering over thirteen centuries tells that ancient
        Japanese paintings, such as scroll-paintings, paintings
        on sliding doors and folding screens, and <em>Suiboku</em>
        (black-and-white) paintings, were almost entirely arts
        for nobles and warrior-class people. This was, in a
        sense, inevitable, for the nucleus of Japanese culture in
        and before the Middle Ages was formed by the noble and
        warrior classes which, of course, were but a small
        portion of the society. Commoners could not afford,
        either financially or spiritually, to enjoy cultural life.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Japan had its
        first contact with Europe in the second half of the
        sixteenth century. Trade with Portugal began. The
        introduction of the match-lock gun caused the building of
        castles, and &quot;castle towns&quot; prospered with
        commoners engaged in commerce and industry. Citizens
        became better off, and came to have social influence.
        Under the regime of the feudal government, however,
        commoners could not rank with nobles and warriors,
        however rich they might have been. Commoners were
        commoners, after all. They had to seek a free world
        within the limited scope of their living. The resorts of
        popular merriments in the capital city, Kyoto, centered
        around the riverside at Shijo, or the gay quarters at
        Yoshiwara in Edo, the seat of the central feudal
        government, were outcomes of commoners' longing for
        freedom. The widespread vogue of picnics, carouses,
        music, dance, Kabuki play and other popular enjoyments
        was the reflection of the general atmosphere of commoners
        to entertain themselves. Common citizenry came to enjoy
        their own happy life, after the sixteenth century. Such
        merry life of commoners began, for the first time in the
        history of Japanese art, to be depicted as main subject
        matters of art, in what art called &quot;early genre
        paintings.&quot;</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Early genre
        paintings were painted for the most part by artists of
        the Kano School. Kano Hideyori, Kano Eitoku, Kano Naizen,
        Kano Naganobu, Kano Yoshinobu and other such Kano School
        artists, whose genre paintings exist in a considerable
        number, were <em>goyo eshi</em> or &quot;service artists&quot;
        employed by nobles or feudal lords, and their styles were
        grandiose and dignified to the taste of the upper-class
        people. Men who enjoyed these genre paintings, too, must
        have been of the same classes as those who enjoyed
        classical flowers-and-birds or dignified Chinese figures,
        that is, nobles and feudal military lords. The living of
        commoners could not have been bettered enough to produce
        art by commoners to be enjoyed by commoners.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The social
        conditions gradually changed from about the time when the
        dictator Toyotomi Hideyoshi, living in Kyoto, died in
        1598, and Tokugawa Ieyasu replacing the Toyotomis founded
        his military government in Edo (now Tokyo). Edo was a new
        city. Unlike in Kyoto the traditional capital since the
        ancient Heian Period, a free world, free from the
        restrictions of tradition, could be created in the new
        city Edo. Citizens of Edo wanted to create art by and for
        themselves. There appeared many anonymous artists, not of
        the traditional Kano School or of the conservative Toga
        School, but who sprang out of an entirely new soil. They
        were more of artizans than of artists. None of their
        numerous genre paintings has any signature. Kano School
        painters such as Eitoku, Naizen and Naganobu mentioned
        before used either to sign or put seal-marks on their
        works. No artist of genre paintings in the Edo Period
        signed. The artists of the famous &quot;Yuna&quot; (women
        of gay quarters), &quot;Portrait of Honda Heihachiro,&quot;
        and pictures of beautiful women in the 1660's, high
        though the paintings are in artistic value, are entirely
        unknown. The reasons for this fact probably were that
        these artists were not men of traditional schools of art,
        and that their pride did not allow them to sign their
        works dealing with the life of the then despised common
        people. Nevertheless their art was very much different
        from the &quot;early genre paintings.&quot; The latter
        were painted by artists of traditional schools and
        appreciated by men of upper classes, while the former
        were painted by anonymous artists of the commoner class
        and were enjoyed by commoners. Herein lay the
        fountainhead of Ukiyo-e, the art truly for the common
        people.</font><font size="3"><br>

        The word Ukiyo (meaning &quot;floating world &quot;)
        included in this term seems to tell that Ukiyo-e (&quot;pictures
        of ukiyo&quot;) are pictures depicting scenes of popular
        enjoyments in the world of common citizenry, which at the
        time were chiefly gay quarters and Kabuki play. However,
        the landscape prints produced in great quantity in the
        end of the Edo Period did not deal with such scenes of
        enjoyments. Ukiyo-e in its early period, too, was not
        dedicated to subjects from gay quarters and Kabuki
        theaters alone. It seems more reasonable to interpret the
        term to mean pictures depicting everyday life of
        contemporary people, as contrasted with works of the Kano
        School artists who treated of Chinese figures or flowers-and-birds,
        and of the Tosa School artists devoting themselves to
        subjects from such classic literary tales as the <em>Genji
        Monogatari</em> and <em>Heike Monogatari</em>. It means
        &quot;Pictures of Ukiyo,&quot; that is, pictures of

        (hanging scrolls). Artists and their subject matters
        certainly were of the commoner class, but brushwork
        paintings are art objects for a limited scope of
        priviledged men. There can not be two same paintings. A
        same work can not be obtained by two persons. This is not
        fair for commoners. In order that a work of art may be
        truly for the common people, there should be many copies
        so that anyone can obtain one, and moreover its price has
        to be always low. To meet these conditions, there could

        in everyday life of commoners were reproduced by him for
        the first time in woodcut printing, the demotic form of

        of Ukiyo-e was Iwasa Matabei. This legendary ascription
        has been disproved by scholars, but is still believed by
        many of the public. The problem had long been argued
        since 1897, and no scholar now believes that Matabei was
        the founder of Ukiyo-e. There does not exist a single
        piece of Ukiyo-e among his existing works. There are
        quite a number of pictures portraying beauties in his
        peculiar style, with long, full cheeks, but they are all
        figures connected with ancient Japanese literature. He
        was an artist of the Tosa School, as he called himself in
        the inscription on two of his works. We can not see how
        he came to be regarded as the founder of Ukiyo-e. One
        theory suggests that it was caused by the confusion with
        Domo-no-Matabei, the artist who originated the simple,
        popular type of painting called Otsu-e, though the
        identity is not fully believable. Works by Iwasa Matabei
        usually bear the seal-marks reading &quot;Sho-i,&quot;
        &quot;Hekishokyu&quot; or &quot;Do-un,&quot; but there
        exist some paintings without any seal or signature which

        the scroll-paintings &quot;Horie Monogatari&quot; and

        size="3" face="Arial">Once the new mass-production form,
        namely woodcut printing, was invented, later Ukiyo-e came
        to be made almost exclusively by this system. The history
        of Ukiyo-e for nearly two centuries, from the Genroku Era
        (c. 1688) down to the beginning of the Meiji Era, was no
        other than the history of the development of woodcut
        prints. During these two centuries, hundreds of Ukiyo-e
        artists appeared, and probably millions of Ukiyo-e prints
        were produced. There were scores of artists among them
        who were skilled in brush painting, such as: Hishikawa
        Moronobu, Kaigetsudo Ando and Miyagawa Choshun in the
        early period of Ukiyo-e; and Katsukawa Shunsho, Chobunsai
        Eishi, katsushika Hokusai and Ando Hiroshige after the
        middle. Some of these artists worked in brushwork besides
        specializing in woodcut prints. There were a great number
        of Ukiyo-e artists who never painted in brushwork, but
        there were not many more than ten who never made prints.
        They were Kaigetsudo Ando, and his pupils excepting Dohan
        and Doshin, and Miyagawa Choshun and his pupils.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The invention of
        woodcut printing thus brought about the pre-eminent
        prevalence of prints in Ukiyo-e. Brush painting became
        not much more than a hobby for Ukiyo-e artists. There can
        be mentioned several reasons to account for this fact. In
        the first place, the purpose of Ukiyo-e was to be enjoyed
        by general public. Brush painting, to be produced in one
        and only one copy, did not meet this purpose. In the
        second place, Ukiyo-e artists, unlike the artists of the
        Kano and Tosa Schools, were sort of amateurs without the
        experience of regular study and training in artistic
        techniques. Although they were skilled in making block
        copies, it required much of regular learning as well as
        confidence for them to paint formal works in colours on
        silk. It was possible only for Chobunsai Eishi, born in a
        family of the warrior class and fully qualified as a
        professional painter with his study under Kano Eisen in
        his childhood, to display the unsurpassed skill in brush
        painting among Ukiyo-e artists. It was with the
        experience in regular course of painting under the Kano
        School, that Hanabusa Itcho could attain his distinctive
        unconventional style of brushwork. Other artists, though
        good at drawing block copies for woodcut prints, did not
        have the skill and confidence in it with which to work
        out dignified brush paintings.</font><font size="3"><br>

        size="3" face="Arial">The third was the discovery of the
        beauty peculiar to prints. The sharp, elastic lines
        produced by engraving with a knife can never be drawn
        with a brush. A beauty of a kind entirely different from
        that of drawn lines was discovered in prints. Colours,
        too, showed a new kind of beauty. The effect of colours,
        produced by rubbing a sheet of paper placed on a colour-painted
        wood-block, was absolutely different from that of brush-painted
        colours. As will be discussed later, the beauty of the
        colours of Japanese woodcut prints is unrivalled among
        prints of the world. Prints of other countries are mostly
        in black monochrome, the colours put by brushwork. China
        has colour prints, but they are printed in only a few
        colours. It is in Ukiyo-e prints alone that pictures are
        printed in more than ten colours. The method of such
        polychrome printing was a purely Japanese invention. The
        peculiar beauty of colours in Ukiyo-e owed much to the
        quality of the paper used, especially the <em>hosho</em>
        paper of thick, soft quality. Colours printed on this
        kind of paper produce a mild, delicate and serene tone.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The print form
        of Ukiyo-e thus created beauty of a kind never found in
        brush painting, or in prints in other parts of the world.
        Probably this was the most important reason why Ukiyo-e
        artists gave up brush painting and devoted themselves to
        woodcut prints. However, the first woodcut prints made by
        Moronobu were not printed in such beautiful colours.
        Older prints were in black monochrome, and that in
        contours only. This monochrome prints were called
        Sumizuri-e, meaning &quot;black-printed-pictures.&quot;
        To the artists of Kyoto, where they were familiar with
        the colourful brush paintings, such somber prints in
        black monochrome must have appeared unworthy to be called
        works of art. This was one of the reasons why woodcut
        printing did not flourish in Kyoto. Edo, on the other
        hand, did not have tradition in art. Black monochrome
        printing was certainly poor-looking, but it was in the
        spirit of citizens of Edo to maintain and promote this
        new form of art. Woodcut printing was destined to be the
        special product of Edo.</font><font size="3"><br>

        size="3" face="Arial">Prints in black monochrome, however
        cheap, were not entertaining enough. Artists had the idea
        to put a few colours, such as cinnabar or violet, in
        brushwork inside the black-printed contours. This was the
        Tan-e, meaning &quot;cinnabar pictures.&quot; Specimens
        of this kind are found in works by Moronobu, Torii
        Kiyomasu the First and other early artists. It was the
        outcome of the desire to bring the effect of brush
        paintings on prints.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The Tan-e had a
        remarkable development from the end of the seventeenth to
        the beginning of the eighteenth century. The newly
        developed form was the Beni-e (&quot;rouge-red pictures&quot;),
        otherwise called Urushi-e (&quot;lacquer-black pictures&quot;).
        The Beni-e had red instead of cinnabar, as well as
        several other colours such as yellow, green and purple,
        all in brushwork. Some of later Beni-e had black portions
        in glossy black like the black of lacquer, produced by
        mixing glue in the black colour. This type was
        specifically called Urushi-e. The Beni-e (or Urushi-e) at
        first were coloured in a very simple manner, but later on
        they began to be painted elaborately in many colours.
        More elaborate processes came to be required. The
        increase of elaborateness in brushwork colouring meant
        the loss of the most important merit of Ukiyo-e prints,
        the life of which was mass-production for multitude. The
        elaboration of Urushi-e by Okumura Masanobu, okumura
        Toshinobu, Nishimura Shigenaga and other artists of the
        Kyoho Era (1716-1735) accelerated the downfall of Ukiyo-e
        as popular art.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">In the early
        1740's, inspired by Chinese prints in two or three simple
        colours, Ukiyo-e artists devised a technique of colour
        printing. This was the second important development in
        Ukiyo-e. Pictures of this sort at first were simple ones
        in two colours, red and green, called Benizuri-e (red-printed-pictures).
        For the first time Japanese woodcut prints came to be
        printed in colours, eighty years after the beginning of
        Ukiyo-e prints by Moronobu. The period of Benizuri-e
        lasted for about twenty years, until Nishiki-e or
        polychrome printing was invented.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Woodcut printing
        had the third, and final, development in 1765. It was the
        invention of polychrome printing, called Nishiki-e (brocade-picture),
        nishiki here meaning colourful. Ukiyo-e prints are
        otherwise called Edo-e or Nishiki-e. The term Edo-e was
        derived from the fact that Ukiyo-e prints became the
        special product of Edo. Nishiki-e, in the strict sense of
        the word, means polychrome prints after 1765. It is not
        right to call the older types of prints, namely Sumizuri-e,
        Tan-e, Urushi-e and Benizuri-e, by the term Nishiki-e.
        Nishiki-e means beautiful colour prints, beautiful as
        brocade.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">It was a vogue
        among dilettantes in the New Year of 1765 to exchange
        smart gifts of their own original designs. A few poets of
        haikai, the Japanese seventeen-syllable poetry, designed
        pictures, and had them drawn for woodcut printing by the
        Ukiyo-e artist, Suzuki Harunobu, and exchanged the
        printed pictures as New Year's gifts. The polychrome
        printing method was invented by Harunobu on this
        occasion, by improving the technique of Benizuri-e. This
        was the beginning of Nishiki-e.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The Ukiyo-e
        prints, unlike prints of other countries, are not drawn
        and printed by a single artist. A print is produced by
        the cooperation of three persons, the artist, the
        engraver, and the printer. At first the artist alone
        signed on prints. The names of the engraver and the
        printer never appeared on them. Among the prints made in
        1765, however, there were some which bore the names,
        besides that of the artist Harunobu, of the Engravers So-and-so
        and the Printers So-And-so. This was an exceptional
        system at the time, and it meant that the new form of
        Nishiki-e was a great renovation not only in the artistic
        style but in the manners of engraving and printing as
        well. The names of engravers and printers, inscribed
        manifestly on the pictures, were the monuments, so to
        speak, of this epoch-making event in the history of Ukiyo-e.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Colour prints
        previously were in two colours, red and green. The
        Nishiki-e succeeded in printing in a few more colours,
        and later in as many as fifteen or sixteen colours. It
        became possible to print a colour on another colour, or
        to print in intermediate or halt-tone colours.
        Previously, all things in prints, either human figures or
        animals or landscapes, had been presented in the two
        colours. There was no consistency between objects and
        colours. Nishiki-e for the first time gave objects their
        true colours. This was an extremely significant reform in
        colours of Ukiyo-e. The development of Ukiyo-e after 1765
        was no other than the development of elaborateness: there
        was no fourth renovation, as far as the form of printing
        was concerned. The perfection of Nishiki-e was a summit
        of the form of Ukiyo-e.</font><font size="3"><br>

        size="3" face="Arial">The origin of Ukiyo-e was in the
        desire for artistic representation of popular enjoyments
        of commoners. It originated in the demand of citizen of
        Edo, who, unsatisfied with paintings of Chinese figures
        or classical literary subjects, wanted to find in art
        something more familiar in their actual life. Their chief
        enjoyments were in Yoshiwara, the gay quarters of Edo,
        and in Kabuki theaters. It was natural that the subject
        matters for Moronobu and other early artists should have
        been women of Yoshiwara or actors of Kabuki. Subjects of
        early Ukiyo-e were. limited to beauties and Kabuki actors</font><font
        size="3">－</font><font size="3" face="Arial">no
        landscapes or flowers-and-birds were dealt with. Artists
        did not have specialities as later artists did, some
        specializing in beauties, some in actors, etc. Artists
        working chiefly with actors also depicted beauties, and
        those experienced in beauties also made portraits of
        actors. This phenomenon was conspicuous especially in the
        periods of Sumizuri-e and brush-coloured monochrome
        prints. Pictures of actors and pictures of beauties did
        not show distinct difference in style.<br>
        </font><font size="3">　</font><font size="3"
        face="Arial">The Torii Family already in this period had
        a peculiar financial connection with Kabuki theaters, and
        specialized in making picture signboards and billets for
        them. Torii Kiyonobu, Torii Kiyomasu, Torii Kiyonobu the
        Second, Torii Kiyomitsu, and other artists in the
        successive generations of the family all worked for
        theaters, and the Torii Family is continued to the
        present day maintaining its relation with the Kabuki. The
        case is very unusual in the world of Ukiyo-e, in which
        the vicissitudes of artists and schools are very rapid
        and radical. However, Kiyonobu, Kiyomasu and other early
        artists of the Torii Family pictured beauties as well as
        actors.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Paper used in
        the period of Sumizuri-e and Tan-e was very large, in the
        size called &quot;extra-large print size.&quot; After the
        period of Urushi-e it became comparatively smaller, in
        the sizes such as those called &quot;narrow print size&quot;
        or &quot;large print size.&quot; Prints in the Tan-e
        period were much like brush paintings in style. A beauty,
        for example, was depicted in a large, well-built figure
        occupying the entire space of paper. Ukiyo-e in brushwork
        was very fashionable in this period, and prints were
        print versions, so to speak, of brush paintings. It may
        be said that prints in this period were under the
        influence of brushwork Ukiyo-e. For example, beauties in
        Sumizuri-e or Tan-e by Torii Kiyonobu, Okumura Masanobu
        in his early part of life, Kaigetsudo Dohan, Kaigetsdo
        Doshin, Furuyama Moromasa and other such artists,
        impressive works though they are, are practically woodcut
        reproductions of beauties by Kaigetsudo Ando. They do not
        show any style peculiar to prints.</font><font size="3"><br>

        size="3" face="Arial">Kaigetsudo Ando, with his more than
        ten pupils, lived at Asakusa (near Yoshiwara) in Edo, and
        painted many portraits of women of Yoshiwara in brushwork.
        His beauties were always in a fixed form, depicting them
        in a Standing pose, and in side-views either from the
        right or from the left, the figure in a sort of S-shape
        with the stomach projecting foreward. The term &quot;Kaigetsudo
        beauties&quot; will immediately remind us of women in
        this style. The contour lines are greatly fluctuating in
        breadth like in brush painting, and the colours are
        bright and deep. Artists of the school of this Kaigetsudo
        Ando always depicted beauties in this similar pose, and
        never tried to create a new style. Such making of similar
        paintings, although in brushwork, was a sort of mass-production.
        It had the same purpose as prints. Presumably they were
        produced to the demand of a part of citizens of Edo, who
        were not satisfied with the cheap but poor-looking prints.
        They may be understood to be products of a transitional
        epoch in which woodcut prints had not yet created the
        original beauty of prints.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Beauties in
        brushwork were the speciality also of Miyagawa Choshun
        and men of his school, such as Miyagawa Issho, Miyagawa
        Seiko and Miyagawa Choki. Beauties of this school were
        less &quot;gorgeous&quot; and more &quot;pretty&quot;
        than those of the Kaigetsudo School. In age they were
        somewhat later, probably covering from the Kyoho Era (1716-1735)
        to the Horeki Era (1751-1763). Prints in this period were
        represented by Urushi-e then at the height of prosperity.
        They were creating a beauty different from that of brush
        paintings.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Demand for
        portraits of Kabuki actors increased more and more among
        citizens, and prints came to secure its <em>raison d'etre</em>
        as far as portraits of actors were concerned. Actor
        portraits of this period, such as by the Torii School
        artists, Okumura Masanobu or Nishimura Shigenaga, were
        not realistic enough to reproduce the characteristics of
        individual actors. Faces were all similar in a kind of
        fixed form, so that one could not tell who the depicted
        actors were by the faces alone. Actor portraits in the
        period of Urushi-e, therefore, always had the names of
        the actors and their roles in dramas inscribed in the
        pictures. Otherwise the owner of a portrait could not
        have known whose portrait it was.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">This was not the
        case with actor portraits alone. Prints depicting
        beauties also were similar to one another, and moreover
        there were styles in common among different artists.
        Beauties by Okumura Masanobu and those by Nishimura
        Shigenaga are very much similar. Beauties by Torii
        Kiyonobu the Second and those by Okumura Masanobu also
        are extremely like each other. Styles of artists are
        common among them. Artists do not have their distinctive
        styles. The same can be said about portraits of actors,
        and there are even cases in which it is hard to tell
        whether a picture is of a beauty or of an actor. A
        picture appearing like a beauty may occasionally be a
        portrait of an oyama or Kabuki actor playing the role of
        a girl. All actor portraits are similar, all beauties are
        similar, and actors and women are similar. This is an
        important characteristic of early Ukiyo-e prints.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">As discussed
        before, the art of Ukiyo-e had an epoch-making
        development in 1765. The perfection of polychrome woodcut
        printing, well worth being called the pride of Japan,
        created beauty of a kind totally different from that of
        brush painting. Prints were no longer under the way of
        brush paintings, and came to have their own original
        style. Specialization in subjects, namely actors and
        beauties, was secured. Suzuki Harunobu held high fame as
        an artist devoted to beauty depiction. Katsukawa Shunsho
        and Ippitsusai Buncho dealt exclusively with actors
        alone, and secured their positions in this field side by
        side with Torii School artists.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Beauties in
        prints at first used to be depicted alone, without any
        background showing the interior of their houses. After
        the time of Harunobu they came to have backgrounds
        depicted in detail, presenting them in connection with
        their daily life. Actor portraits came to be down with
        realistic depiction of their facial characteristics, so
        much so that it became no longer necessary to inscribe
        the names and roles of the actors depicted. This meant
        the success of Nigao-e (&quot;likeness-pictures&quot;).
        Beauties by Harunobu were lovely and chaste like dolls.
        He depicted these figures of sentimental beauty in
        romantic scenes of love. His prints were rendered with
        the life and milieu of women. It was a new aspect of art
        never found in prints prior to the Benizuri-e.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Once Harunobu
        got high popularity among citizens of Edo, all other
        contemporary artists began to imitate his style. Even
        such artists without any relationship in art with
        Harunobu, as Isoda Koryusai, Komai Yoshinobu, Shiba
        Kokan, Ippitsusai Buncho and Katsukawa Shunsho,
        reproduced the Harunobu style in their pictures of
        beauties and actors. The lack of individuality, like in
        the period of Urushi-e, showed again among Ukiyo-e
        artists of this epoch. The fact that even Katsukawa
        Shunsho and Ippitsusai Buncho, specializing in portrayal
        of actors, were influenced by the Harunobu style, shows
        the character of Ukiyo-e intrinsic in it. What was the
        cause that brought on this character? Presumably it was
        the pressure by publishers, and the lack of artistic
        conscience on the part of artists themselves. If
        Harunobu, for instance, gets great popularity, publishers
        force other artists to work in the style of Harunobu.
        Ukiyo-e artists were at the mercy of people's fancy. They
        had to respect the demand of publishers and citizens at
        the cost of their own style, in order to maintain their
        living and popularity. Although having freed itself from
        the sway of brush painting in style, and become
        diversified in specialized subjects, the art of Ukiyo-e
        in this period was not much different from that of the
        period of Urushi-e in the fundamental lack of
        individuality.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">After the death
        of Harunobu in 1770, his spell on Ukiyo-e which had
        limited the style of other artists dispersed for a while.
        Artists, from about the following year, began to work in
        their respective original styles. It may have been a
        resistance against Harunobu's romanticism which had
        outrivalled them. Beauties depicted by them lost the
        frail loveliness and became fleshy and healthy-looking.
        The realistic presentation of beauties by Isoda Koryusai,
        Kitao Shigemasa, Kitao Masanobu, and Torii Kiyonaga,
        active in the An-ei Era (1772-1780), was a sort of revolt
        against the dream-like atmosphere of Harunobu.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Out of these
        rivalling artists each with his own style, Torii Kiyonaga
        gradually raised his head, and finally brought about a
        period of his Predominance. Though a man of the Torii
        Family specializing in actor portrayal, he for a certain
        reason almost never made pictures of actors. His
        favourite subject was women in a group. which he depicted
        in flowing lines and bright colours. He was not satisfied
        with the usual paper size of about 39 cm. by 26 cm., but
        created a large space consisting of three separate sheets
        of this size with continued pictures. Beauties by
        Kiyonaga were full of sensuous beauty. This new type of
        beauty again came to pervade over the world of Ukiyo-e.
        Ukiyo-e of the Temmei Era (1781-1788) was monopolized by
        the Kiyonaga style. Katsukawa Shunsho, Katsukawa Shuncho,
        Chobunsai Eishi, and Kitagawa Utamaro still in his youth,
        could not be free from Kiyonaga's influence.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Kitagawa
        Utamaro, however, was a man of unyielding spirit.
        Submerged in the flood of the Kiyonaga style he secretly
        studied the styles of preceding artists, looking foreward
        to future success. In 1791, at the age of thirty-nine, he
        created an unprecedented form of beauty depiction, and
        presently displaced Kiyonaga. It was the invention of the
        form called Okubi-e, meaning &quot;large-head-picture.&quot;
        Pictures of beauties in the preceding period were
        presented in full length, and in groups. Utamaro left out
        the lower half, and showed the head and upper half of the
        body in close-up. His intention was to reproduce the
        beauty of women by enlarged and emphasized depiction of
        the face. It was an entirely new viewpoint of female
        beauty. Chobunsai Eishi and his pupils Eisho, Eisui and
        Eiri, as well as many minor artists of the Kansei Era (1789-1800),
        again followed the style of Utamaro.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">In actor
        portraits, on the other hand, the Nigao-ei or likenesses
        of actors originated by Katsukawa Shunsho which were
        really like respective actors, overpowered the formalism
        of the Torii School. Shunsho's art cultivated a new field
        in portrayal of actors. It seems that Shunsho in his late
        years developed an original style in brush paintings of
        beauties. There exist a good many fine works of this sort.
        It was the art of Toshusai Sharaku that brought to
        perfection the realism of Nigao-e by Shunsho and his
        pupils, Shun-ei and Shunko.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Almost nothing
        is known about the life and career of Sharaku. The period
        of his activity was only ten months, from May of 1794 to
        February of 1795. During this period the mysterious
        artist produced about a hundred and forty portraits of
        actors. His whereabouts after that is totally unknown.
        These comparatively few works, however, had high artistic
        value with which they astounded present-day artists of
        the world. They reproduced instantaneous expressions of
        actors on stage with astonishing strength by
        impressionistic depiction of eyes, noses, mouths and
        hands. His art was a drastic impressionism. It was high
        aloof from other artists, but his too much distinctive
        style did not find a man to inherit it. The art of actor
        portrayal of the Shunsho School was transmitted rather to
        the modest style of Utagawa Toyokuni.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Toyokuni
        published, from about 1794 or 1795, a series of about
        twenty portraits of actors entitled &quot;Pictures of
        Actors on stage.&quot; They are masterpieces skilfully
        reproducing the characteristics of respective actors and
        their roles within fine formalistic beauty. They are not
        only the representative works of Toyokuni's art, but are
        supreme works in the history of Ukiyo-e in this field.
        His later works could never surpass this series.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The Kansei Era (1789-1800)
        was the golden age of Ukiyo-e. In the depiction of
        beauties there were such geniuses as Kitagawa Utamaro,
        Chobunsai Eishi and Kubo Shumman. In the portrayal of
        actors there were the distinguished talents, Sharaku and
        Toyokuni. Ukiyo-e reached a summit in this period both in
        style and in technique. After this period these great
        talents passed away one after another, and the art of
        Ukiyo-e in both fields was on the decline. Ukiyo-e in the
        Bunka-Bunsei Eras (1804-1829) and afterwards, was
        represented by Keisai Eisen, Utagawa Kunisada and Utagawa
        Kuniyoshi, but the glory of the Kansei rperiod was not
        restored. Ukiyo-e both of actors and of beauties came to
        dead stand. A change of front, so to speak, was necessary.</font><font

        size="3" face="Arial">The genius who presented himself at
        this turning point was Katsushika Hokusai. He at first
        learned from Katsukawa Shunsho, and specialized in
        portraits of actors. Later he changed his pet subject to
        beauties, which he depicted in the Utamaro style. This he
        again gave up early in the Bunka Era (1804-1817) and
        cultivated an entirely new field of Ukiyo-e. It was
        landscapes. Ukiyo-e originally began with the depiction
        of popular enjoyments. It successfully reproduced human
        life, but had little interest in nature. Hishikawa
        Moronobu and Nishimura Shigenaga had landscapes, it is
        true, but they were imitations of Toga School landscapes
        if not sight-seeing pictures, so to speak. They were not
        reproductions of real natural sights. Utagawa Toyoharu
        made some landscapes, too, but his were not realistic
        sketches from nature. The above-mentioned were not worth
        being called true landscapes.</font><font size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Hokusai created
        a new type of landscape art, inspired by the Western-style
        copper-plate prints then fashionable. It was not the
        idealistic landscape of the Toga School, but was the
        faithful reproduction of natural sights with which
        citizens of Edo were familiar. He devoted his great
        talent to this new held. and finally completed, at sixty-nine.
        the undying masterpieces, &quot;Thirty-six Views of Mt.
        Fuji,&quot; in a series of forty-six pictures. They
        depicted the &quot;sacred mountain&quot; of Japan from
        all possible distances and angles of sight, dotted here
        and there with pictures of the life of common people.</font><font
        size="3"><br>
        　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The efforts of
        Hokusai brought a period of great prosperity of landscape
        prints. His greatest successor was the famous Ando
        Hiroshige. Keisai Eisen and Utagawa Kuniyoshi, at first
        specializing in beauties, also followed in his wake.
        Hiroshige was a man of character entirely different from
        that of Hokusai. Hokusai was rational and realistic,
        while Hiroshige was poetic in his depiction of the
        beautiful nature of Japan. He favourably treated the
        beauty of nature in various weathers, rainy, windy, foggy
        or snowy, in a pathetic atmosphere as a traveller might
        feel far from his home. It may be said that Ukiyo-e
        landscape of purely Japanese taste was perfected by
        Hiroshige.</font><font size="3"><br>

        the real life of man. Even landscapes were reproductions
        of nature inseparably connected with man. They have the
        &quot;smell&quot; of man always pervading over them.
        Ukiyo-e never existed apart from man and man's life. What
        the hundreds of Ukiyo-e artists pursued was the aspects
        of man in respective periods, and what was expressed in
        their art was the beauty of man. These were not painted

        art. It was for these two distinctive types of beauty
        that Ukiyo-e, ahead of all other kinds of Japanese art,
        got the admiration of European artists, and secured for
        it a high position among arts of the world. It was also
        due to its profound humanism, or the expression of
