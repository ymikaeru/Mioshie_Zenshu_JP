    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">That which is believed to cure disease and
    decrease the number of invalids, is actually having the
    reverse effect. It obstructs the cure of disease and
    increases the number of invalids.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The reason is so obvious that it seems to me
    needless of explanation, but few are aware of it. It may be
    considered the greatest enigma of the twentieth century. Men
    have been enslaved by blind reliance upon medical science,
    and they believe that the problem of disease can be brought
    about by its progress.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Medical science stands on a premise which is
    opposed to the truth. Its approach to disease is erroneous.
    All its mistakes start from incorrect knowledge.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man, without exception, has two types of &quot;dokuso&quot;
    (toxin or poison) within him; one is congenital, the other is
    postgenital. The former is, of course, hereditary, and the
    latter is taken into his body in the form of various kinds of
    medicine during his lifetime.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This may sound very strange, because medicine
    has been generally considered to be a remedy and maintainer
    of health. Medicine has played the chief role in medical
    treatment.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Actually there is nothing which deserves the
    title of &quot;medicine&quot; in existence. What is referred
    to as medicine is in reality a poison. It is effective
    because it is a poison. The poison, which is generally titled
    &quot;medicine,&quot; suppresses the symptoms of disease
    temporarily; so it appears to have cured the disease, but in
    reality it never cures it.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Creator provided mankind with food when He
    created man. There are two types of food; food man should
    eat, and food man should not eat. The difference is natural
    and apparent, and there should be no hesitation about which
    to select.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Food suitable for man is tasty to man. Man is
    provided with a sense of taste. What is required of man is
    only to take what is palatable to him, and good nourishment
    is thereby guaranteed. This is adhering to the original plan
    of the Creator. Man was created to enjoy food, and ample
    nourishment naturally accompanies it; he was not created to
    eat only to maintain health.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The internal organs of the human body can not
    dispose of foreign substance; and as medicine is foreign
    material it remains in the body unused except for its
    nutritive element. This is what I call &quot;toxin&quot; or
    &quot;medicinal poison&quot; (yakudoku). The particles of
    toxin gradually collect in several parts of the body, and are
    solidified in time. These are confined at points where the
    busiest and finest nerves are located, especially in the
    upper half of the body</font><font size="3">－</font><font
    size="3" face="Arial">largely above the neck, viz., the
    brain, eyes, ears, nose and mouth.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Before it reaches these parts, &quot;toxin&quot;
    is collected and solidified around the neck. Everyone has a
    solidified collection of toxin around his neck or in his
    shoulders. We sometimes feel &quot;stiff&quot; in these parts.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When the collection reaches a certain degree,
    there occurs a natural excreting activity which I call &quot;purification,&quot;
    e.g., we contract a fever in the body; toxin is dissolved by
    this fever, and excreted in the form of coughing, sputum,
    nasal mucus, sweat, loose bowels, or urine. These symptoms
    are generally referred to as a &quot;cold&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Thus, a cold is a specific process to excrete
    toxin from the body. If we tolerate the pain for a while, the
    toxin in the body will disappear. This is a remarkable and
    simple physical function provided by Providence to purify the
    body. We should understand this function, but people
    misconstrued its purpose and have devised a medical treatment
    to obstruct it. Here one must note man's major fundamental
    mistake.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The purifying action is achieved proportionately
    to the vitality of the human body, and the only way to
    prevent the purifying action is to weaken tlle vitality. All
    medicinal poison has accomplished, is to bring about the
    weakening of this vitality. Since olden times, man has
    manufactured various kinds of &quot;medicine&quot; which have
    proved effective only in suppressing purifying action.
    Medicine in the form of liquids, pills, liniments, and
    injections are manufactured by boiling down, grinding or
    extracting an essence from grass root, wood bark, minerals or
    animal matter.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Medicine becomes fatal if its poisonous
    ingredients are too potent, so it is weakened or diluted and
    divided into doses. Effective medicine means medicine which
    contains the maximum amount of poison without causing
    toxication.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">All men today have toxin within them. They have
    used remedies which further solidify toxin, suppressing the
    physical function of dissolving and excreting. Nervous
    practices of sanitation and their feal of contracting colds
    exemplify how they have become very vulnerable to disease and
    how much poison is contained in their bodies.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man is proud of the fact that his life span has
    been extended to a little over sixty years. This also is a
    mistaken conception. If he lived without disease, he would
    easily live a hundred years. Death under a hundred years is
    an unnatural fatality caused by disease. If man exists
    without disease, he will live additional years.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Medical treatment does not cure disease; it only
    mitigates pain temporarily. Rest cures, wet-dressings,
    ointments, cooling by ice, electrical cures, therapeutic
    treatment, etc., are all in reality nothing but methods which
    suppress the excretion of toxin.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There are a few remedies among these which
    possess some special features; e. g., moxibustion and
    thermotherapy (cure by heat). These produce stimulus by heat
    in certain sections of the body, and induce toxin to collect
    in these places. They give an invalid temporary relief, but
    with the lapse of time, the relief soon retrogresses. They
    are, therefore, actually of no value.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There is also a method which claims to destroy
    cancer by radium. It would be a wonderful cure if it
    destroyed cancer only, but it injures the unaffected internal
    organs at the same time. This treatment possesses damaging
    factors which far surpass the constructive factors.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">All past and present medical treatment
    suppresses the natural functions of the body; there can be no
    true cure except the means which assists the natural
    excretion of toxin. Medicine is most effective in suppressing
    the excretion of toxin, and it contains the source of almost
    all disease. It is obvious that the more medical treatment
    one receives, the more accentuated one's disease becomes, and
    in the end, one faces the danger of losing one's life.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is an ironic fact that these invalids who
    assiduously seek and consume costly medicine make
    unfavourable progress, while those indifferent to medicine
    and their physical condition recover rapidly. Many doctors
    admit this fact. Hygiene conscious people are generally
    weaker, while people indifferent to sanitation are healthier.
    lt is said that the families of doctors and nurses working in
    hospitals are generally vulnerable to disease. Most men
    enjoying excellent health and longevity claim they have never
    been ill nor consulted doctors. From my viewpoint, they are
    healthy only because they do not take medicine. Since they
    are healthy, they abstain from medicine. We must give serious
    consideration to these facts.<br>

    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Postgenital toxin is &quot;medicinal poison&quot;,
    while congenital toxin is that which has been transmitted to
    us from our ancestors through many generations. The latter is
    what has popularly been called &quot;congenital syphilis&quot;,
    and medical science has designated it &quot;hereditary
    syphilis&quot;.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This is the aged &quot;medicinal poison&quot;,
    which must also be excreted, and the excretion takes the form
    of small-pox. Not aware of this fact, in 1796, Edward Jenner
    discovered vaccine in England. Since that time, man has been
    made immune from small-pox, and Jenner has been looked upon
    as a savior.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">However, we must remember that vaccination has
    not exterminated the toxin or congenital syphilis which
    causes small-pox. It has only weakened the physical function
    which excreted this toxin. Toxin remains in the body
    unchanged, and becomes the cause of various types of diseases.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Congenital toxin collects somewhere within the
    body and becomes solidified. The natural function which
    attempts to excrete it is a common cold. Congenital toxin
    takes various forms</font><font size="3">－</font><font
    size="3" face="Arial">skin diseases, quasi-infantile-paralysis,
    meningitis, lymphadenitis, etc. The beginning of the
    spiritual depression of the English and French people
    coincides with the discovery of vaccine. We must dispense
    with all medicine to exterminate small-pox in mankind.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Even if we did so, it would not immediately
    release mankind from the poisonous influence of medicine,
    which has resulted from usage for many centuries. It would
    take several generations to get rid of entirely the noxious
    influence of medicine on mankind. However, if we abstain from
    medicine, the amount of &quot;medicinal poison&quot; within
    our body will gradually decrease, and if we fall ill, we can
    progress toward cure very favorably. Moreover, if we practise
    &quot;Johrei&quot; (Purification of Soul) treatment of World
    Messianity, we can completely get rid of the medicinal
    residue in our bodies during our lifetime.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Average people need not instantly abandon
    vaccination. If they do not take any other medicine during
    their lives, their children, if attacked by small-pox, will
    be easily cured, and from their grandchildren onward there
    will be no small-pox.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The sole commendable effect of vaccination is to
    prevent pockmarks on the face, while its harm is far greater
    than its effect. Cutaneous and other types of injections
    which are highly valued by doctors today are considered to
    have originated from the idea of vaccination. Their horrible
    influence will be fully discussed in this book.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">One of the most dreadful of medicines is
    salvarsan. The toxication caused by this medicine almost
    invariably affects the brain, causing mental disease; and in
    extreme cases, it will develop into actual mental illness.
    Medical science considers syphilis as a primary cause of
    mental illness, and uses salvarsan injection for the remedy.
    This is a ridiculous illusion on the part of medical science,
    for the very use of this medicine drives even normal people
    to insanity.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The most common diseases caused by &quot;medicinal
    poison&quot; are those of the stomach. They begin with over
    eating, which in turn causes acid stomach condition and
    indigestion. When individuals feel ill, they take medicine,
    and a temporary relief is effected, but with the lapse of
    time the original symptoms again appear. They are suppressed
    with medicine once more, but return again and again.
    Repeating these processes, this dyspepsia becomes chronic.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">If man had only allowed these symptoms to pass,
    they would have normally disappeared. By repeating the
    mistakes outlined above, man himself incurs chronic dyspepsia.
    This foolishness, I hope, is not incurable.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Gastric cramp is a pain which accompanies the
    physical &quot;purification&quot; or the melting process of
    the poison within a body. It can also be suppressed by
    narcotics temporarily; but in many cases, this too develops
    into a habit and becomes chronic.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Gastric ulcers are obviously caused by &quot;medicinal
    poison&quot;. All gastric medicines contain bicarbonate of
    soda. This makes the food soft, but at the same time it also
    softens the membranes of the stomach. If some solid substance
    touches these softened membranes, they are injured and bleed.
    This causes vomiting of blood.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There is another type of gastric ulcer. Blood
    oozes out from the weakened mucus membranes of the stomach
    and collects at the bottom of the stomach. This is excreted
    as bloody excrement. In this case, one will find small black
    clots of blood in the excrement. Fresh blood is red, but old
    blood is always black.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Dyspepsia is the most general type of gastric
    disease. It is caused by the habitual use of digestives. If
    one habitually takes only digestible food and chews it well,
    the functions of one's stomach becomes dull. In repeating
    this, one's dyspepsia becomes chronic. Dyspepsia is thus
    artificially caused by man.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">All medicines aim at a temporary relief and this
    is invariably accompanied by toxication; sedatives for
    headaches, cocain for coryza, lotions for eye-infections,
    Lugol's solution for tonsilitis, ointments and liniments,
    without exception.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is the same with fever. If one leaves it
    alone, it will gradually be less apparent and disappear. If
    one takes antifebrile, it may suppress one's fever
    temporarily, but this relief will soon disappear, and the
    fever must again be suppressed with medicine. In repeating
    this process, it will develop into a lingering fever. A
    doctor will be perplexed by this symptom, and will diagnose
    the case as &quot;fever from an unknown source.&quot; It may
    well be unknown to the doctor, because it is he who has
    caused the fever to remain.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Purgatives and enemas also result in toxication.
    They will only aggravate constipation. It is the same with
    dropsy. A diuretic may increase urine temporarily, but soon
    by its reaction, the dropsy will become intensified. In
    repeating the use of diuretics, the dropsy will become more
    difficult to suppress, and the doctor will decide to extract
    the liquid through an external orifice in the invalid's
    stomach. This last measure also has only a temporary effect,
    and the invalid's stomach soon becomes greatly distended. The
    doctor soon has to abandon hope of saving the invalid's life.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Disinfectants which are used during operations
    are extremely injurious to health. These rank high among the
    &quot;medicinal poisons&quot;. Most people are not aware of
    their harm. It is a violent poison which kills microbes, and
    infiltrates directly into the muscles. The injurious effect
    is great. It creates many diseases, especially those of an
    inveterate nature, including severe pain. Generally, they
    take a very long time to cure.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Diseases of the mucus membranes of the mouth are
    also caused by the habitual use of medicine, which
    infiltrates into the tissue and becomes &quot;toxin&quot;.
    Catarrh or swellings are caused by this toxin in its process
    of excretion.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I have explained from various viewpoints, the
    fact that all diseases have a common source in &quot;medicinal
    poison&quot;. Doctors should ask their patients, in
    diagnosing, what kind of medicine or injection they have
    previously taken or what kind of operation they underwent in
    the past, and thereby determine the root of their present
    disease.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">All &quot;medicinal poison&quot; easily
    solidifies within the body, and is very difficult to excrete.
    It takes a score and sometimes several scores of years and
    often a whole lifetime for complete excretion.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">&quot;Medicinal toxin&quot; is not only caused
    by occidental medicines, it is also caused by oriental
    medicines. Only their symptoms differ. Toxin originated by
    occidental medicines causes acute pain, while that of
    oriental medicines causes dull pain.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Every pain and itch has its cause in &quot;medicinal
    toxin&quot;. If a man does not take medicine, he can pass a
    lifetime without experiencing the pain of disease. Unless we
    expose the fallacy of relying upon medicines, it is my
    assurance that mankind will never be released from the
    relentless agonies of disease.<br>

    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Bacilli do not originate by mere chance, they
    originate with proper reasons, conditions and causes. As long
    as these points are not clarified, the proper feature of
    disease can never be known. Modern medical science
    concentrates too much upon bacilli itself, but it has not yet
    investigated as to where these bacilli originate. In short,
    it is too infantile to combat with the mysterious problems of
    human lives. The problem of disease in general is far from
    being solved with medical science in such a condition.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">For example, tubercular bacilli originate
    spontaneously. Then, where and how do they originate? I will
    now clearly define these points. It is very difficult,
    because an invisible spirit is its object. No man has ever
    tried to clarify these points. My theory stands on sheer
    facts; therefore, no material science can refute it.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Prior to my discourse on the spontaneous
    origination theory, I must make clearly understood the
    constitution of this world. Modern medical science, though it
    boasts of its outstanding exploits, has never clarified this
    point. I know it thoroughly. My theory stands upon the true
    knowledge of world constitution; therefore, you can not help
    wondering and believing it, awakening also to the error of
    medical science.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This world consists of three worlds: material,
    ethereal and spiritual. Human science has hitherto clarified
    only the first two worlds. Modern science has the fatal
    defect, in that it has been fabricated upon these two worlds
    only. The third world, whose existence has hitherto been
    neglected, is the source of all power in this universe. All
    things are born, brought up and developed by power from this
    source.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Scientists, who have not recognized the
    existence of the spiritual world, have fallen into a mistaken
    belief that they can solve any problem through modern science.
    Medical science is a product of this mistaken conviction. It
    is a disabled science. It only tries to suppress the visible
    symptoms of an invalid. It can never thoroughly cure him.
    Here is the fundamental reason why the number of patients is
    not decreased despite medical science.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As medical science stands upon a mistaken
    concept, the more it progresses, the further it strays into a
    labyrinth. It attributes the source of all disease to bacilli.
    In its endeavor to cure one disease, it creates several other
    diseases. It does not heal a disease, it only changes one
    type of disease into another, which is then called a
    secondary disease.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">What is the relation between a man and the
    spiritual world? Of course, a human being is an existence in
    three worlds. A man has a physical body which is material, he
    lives in air and moisture which are also material. Another
    substance, the invisible spirits, is his true feature; and
    here lies the source of all diseases. Materialistic medical
    science handles only diseases in their relation with the
    physical body. It attributes the source of all diseases to
    the physical body, and considers that they are caused by the
    invasion of bacilli from the outside. It takes the standpoint
    of the external cause theory or infection theory, whereas we
    stand upon the internal cause theory or the spontaneous
    origination theory. The former is mechanical and easy to
    understand, while the latter is abstruse and hard to
    understand. People followed the former and fell into
    confusion and delusion.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">What is a man's spiritual body? It is composed
    of ultra-micro particles, which can not be seen by any
    electro-microscope ever-invented. It is the proper human
    being. It is mysterious and abstruse beyond imagination.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Disease first appears as a cloud upon the whole
    or a part of this spiritual body. Clouds are originated by
    two causes. One is sin or impurity committed by man, and the
    other is medicinal toxin. The former is the same as that
    which is preached by the theory of inevitable retribution. If
    a man tortures others or does wrong to society, his sin is
    reflected upon his spiritual body. The latter is a
    combination of his congenital and acquired medical toxin.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Clouds on the spiritual body are similar to
    those in the sky. They are composed of hydrogen. There are
    two types; pure and impure. The former may be likened to a
    cirrus and a stratus in a fine sky; they are harmless. The
    latter are dark clouds; in the course of time they must be
    purified by the wind and rain. It is the purifying function
    in the solar system. It is the same with diseases.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Medical science, not knowing the above truth,
    tries to stop this purifying function, which is beneficial to
    health. Then, the impure clouds increase in density and
    originate prototype bacteria. They are at first inorganic,
    and with the lapse of time, develop into organic existence.
    These organic beings are the germs of bacilli. In the state
    of their maturity, they are called bacilli and can be seen
    through a microscope. They are virus, and science also
    acknowledges their existence.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Then, it is obvious that there is no other
    drastic cure than to dissipate clouds on the spiritual body,
    which are the true source of all diseases. You will also
    recognize that this doctrine is far above the level of modern
    science. The method to dissipate those clouds was revealed to
    me by God, and I was also endowed with that power. Hence, I
    have been able to attain outstanding results in healing
    invalids.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When an administrator shades his hand over an
    invalid, a certain type of ray is emitted from the palm of
    the administrator. This ray is, in short, a quintessence of
    the sun. I have given it the name of &quot;Kaso&quot; (Transcendental
    Fire). As the essence of air is Hydrogen, the essence of
    spirits is &quot;Kaso&quot;. Of course, it is a fire; but
    fire which can be seen and gives heat is physical fire.
    &quot;Kaso&quot; is the spirit of fire or spiritual fire. If
    this spiritual fire is radiated to the clouds on the
    spiritual body of man, impure substances in the clouds are
    burnt out, and the residue is excreted from the spiritual
    body. Pure substances in the clouds melt into the body.
    Clouds are thus dissipated, and the source of diseases is
    dissolved.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Why is it possible for followers of World
    Messianity to radiate &quot;Kaso&quot;, which has such a
    supreme healing power? It is possible through a ray which is
    emitted from a talisman which every follower carries on his
    breast. This talisman is an ideograph written by me, and has
    three types</font><font size="3">－</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">&quot;Light&quot;, &quot;Bright Light&quot; and
    &quot;Brightest Light&quot;. The Holy Ghost of God is
    transmitted through my spiritual body to a talisman, and is
    radiated from the palm of the bearer of the talisman.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Many people may be unable to believe this
    explanation; not a few of them may even harbour ill feeling
    toward it. They may think it is nonsense and an audacious
    fake. It is quite reasonable that they may think so. Because,
    human history has never had such an instance which transcends
    the law of physics. However, a fact is irrefutable. One fact
    is more eloquent than a hundred discourses. In short, Heaven
    has come, and the great mission of the salvation of mankind
    has been entrusted to me by God. Its first step is this
    revolution of medical science. Should you be able to
    understand the above truth, you will see nothing unnatural in
    it.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">What has been preached in this chapter may seem
    very mysterious; but actually there is no mystery. It is
    purely scientific. If you consider it to be mysterious, it is
    because the level of modern science is too low. When science
    will have accomplished a greater progress in future, my
    doctrine may be easily understood by the general public.
    Then, science and religion will be united for the first time,
    and true civilization will be born from the union. The
    objective of learning is said to lie in the research for
    truth. I dare say the final truth has been here discovered,
    and this book is its interpretation.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It may be still difficult for you to believe
    what I have preached. However, what is truth? It is simply a
    reality. The sun rises from the east, and man is born and
    dies. These are realities and truths. What I preach are no
    fancies nor extravagances. All of them are sheer realities.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As I have written in previous chapters, toxin is
    impure blood or a cloud on the spirit. Clouds are generated
    by sins or impurities. Such a conception has been
    characteristic of all religions, but past religions have
    lacked theoretical background for their preachings. They
    admonished men to abstain from doing wrong because such would
    be registered sins or impurities. Such a discourse is too
    simple to convince modern people. A new doctrine should be
    clear in theory and endorsed with irrefutable proofs.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As this world consists of the spiritual and
    material worlds, a man is composed of his spiritual and
    physical bodies. These two bodies are inseparable. They are,
    as a rule, closely united. When clouds on his spiritual body
    are reflected upon his physical body, they become impure
    blood; and when his impure blood is transmitted to his
    spiritual body, it forms a cloud. You must read this part
    very carefully, because it is the key-point.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">If a man does many wrong deeds, his spiritual
    body is clouded by his sins. When these clouds accumulate to
    a certain degree, there occurs the purifying process. It is
    disease, disaster or penal punishment. If he has succeeded in
    evading punishment, he is sure to be punished spiritually
    under the penal code of God. Punishment by God is absolute.
    In this case, he must suffer from great pain with his
    physical body. He must suffer from critical disease, often
    fatal.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The earlier the punishment, the better it is for
    him. It is like a debt. If he does not pay it back early,
    interest will rapidly accumulate. However, there are a few
    bad characters who cleverly elude, during their lives,
    punishment from both men and God. After their death, they are
    thrown, by dint of their gravest sins, into the lowest
    stratum of Hell. Even the most unscrupulous scoundrels can
    not but repent of their sins. It is same as the Hell of
    Eternal Darkness preached by Buddhism, Region of Root
    recorded by Shintoism, or Inferno depicted by Dante. There is
    no light nor heat. Darkness reigns there eternally. The
    spirits of the incorrigible wicked are thrown there, and let
    alone for hundreds of years in their freezing state. They can
    not help but surrender and repent of their sins. Modern
    people may hardly believe my above description, but all of it
    I heard directly from spirits while I was engaged in the
    study of the spiritual world. You may put your absolute
    reliance upon the truthfulness of my description.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When man commits a bad deed, he begins to have a
    reproach for himself. This pain of his mind is a token of
    light &quot;purification&quot;. If he repents at this stage,
    he is saved. However, such a case is rare; in many cases, he
    goes on repeating his sins.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The amount of spiritual clouds differ according
    to the nature or weight of sins. Clouds are also caused from
    outside. When a man tortures others, the anger or grudge of
    these afflicted people reflect upon the torturer's spiritual
    body. It is done through a spiritual line, which transmit an
    idea. When a man pleases others, their feeling of gratitude
    is also transmitted to his spiritual body and so far
    contributes in decreasing its clouds. The more unobtrusively
    he does good deeds, the greater is the commendation from God.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The above is the stern law of God. We can not
    but obey it. The spiritual world is thus ruled, and the above
    are absolute truths. What men can do is only to believe and
    obey them. Spiritual clouds are purified through diseases or
    other disasters. Therefore, if you wish to be happy, you must
    keep your spirit always clean, doing good and abstaining from
    committing sin.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In physical features, the impure blood, which
    has been generated by medicinal toxin, is the source of
    disease. All medicine is poisonous; whereas, it has long been
    considered as beneficial to health. Man lacks the fundamental
    knowledge that diseases are a purifying function, and they
    came to nurture the above erroneous notion.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">A few invalids, who have been cured by &quot;Johrei&quot;
    have a relapse. We call it &quot;repurification&quot;. The
    first &quot;Johrei&quot; purifies toxin locally; it only
    dissipates the toxin which is directly causing disease. The
    invalid is cured temporarily, and begins to work. However,
    with the recovery of his vigor, positive &quot;purification&quot;
    begins. In other words, he becomes vigorous through &quot;purification&quot;,
    and as he recovers his vigor, his invigorated body generates
    more violent &quot;purification&quot;. In repeating these
    processes, the invalid gradually recovers his true health.
    The second &quot;purification&quot; is thus comparatively
    more violent; it accompanies high temperature and severe
    coughing. It means his old sputum is excreted. It is rich and
    smells of medicine. Of course, lack of appetite and
    emanciation add to his symptoms; and in rare cases, he dies
    during his second &quot;purification&quot;. According to our
    statistical report, 7% of the people who have been cured by
    &quot;Johrei&quot; die in their second &quot;purification&quot;,
    and 93% of them become possessors of true health and are now
    vigorously working in their career fields.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I think the above curing percentage is quite
    wonderful. It might become more wonderful, when you consider
    the fact that we handle critical invalids only, who have been
    driven to the threshold of death after they had tried all
    popular, medical, and faith cures. Those seven persons among
    one hundred, who die in their second &quot;purification&quot;,
    are those who have taken too much medicinal toxin in the past.
    &quot;Johrei&quot; is a method to dissipate medicinal toxin.
    Any invalid becomes well by the amount that his toxin has
    been diminished.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Creator has made man as master of this earth.
    Therefore, man is naturally provided with food sufficient to
    maintain life. Each food has its particular taste, and man is
    provided with a sense to enjoy it. Man should eat what he
    wishes to eat. He can keep health good by doing so. It is not
    at all necessary to worry about the value of nutrition of
    food.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">By the above reason, it is obvious that we
    should not take any foreign substance except certain foods
    into our body. We should never eat tasteless or bitter foods.
    These substances themselves are telling us that they are not
    proper foods. The digestive organs do not dispose of anything
    except proper foods. As medicines are foreign substances to
    these organs, they remain in the body and are the cause of
    diseases.<br>

    face="Arial">Recently the advance of surgery is being
    overvalued and emphasized not only in Japan, but also in
    Western countries, especially in the United States. This is a
    great mistake.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The progress of surgery does not mean the
    progress of medical science, but it indicates the
    retrogression of the latter. True medical science should not
    amputate the affected organ, but leave the organ as it is and
    cure the disease.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">By operation, they cut the invalid's flesh,
    cause him to loose blood and expose him to pain. This gives
    the invalid an internal deformity. It is not medical; it is
    anti-medical. I have no words for the ignorance of those who
    believe such a barbarism to be an advanced scientific
    technique.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Once a man damages any part of his body, he must
    suffer its inevitable effect. For instance, it may be
    permissible to take out only the pus by appendectomy, but as
    it is impossible for doctors to do so, they amputate the
    appendix itself. I regard this as barbarous, because the
    Creator has made nothing which is useless on our body.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Doctors often say that the appendix is useless,
    or that one can live with only one kidney. This only
    indicates that they do not know the purpose of these organs
    and how primitive or infantile their medical science is. It
    is also a great blasphemy to God, because doctors are
    creatures of God, too.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">After the appendectomy, the invalid may appear
    to have recovered his health, but after a short interval, he
    is sure to be attacked by another disease. The purpose of the
    appendix is to excrete toxin from the lower half of the body.
    Explained more fully, toxin which first collects behind the
    right kidney soon solidifies there, then in time it is
    gradually liquefied, and moves to the appendix and solidifies
    there.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When this collects to a certain degree, &quot;purification&quot;
    starts, causing fever; and by the fever, the solidified toxin
    begins to dissolve. Appendicitis is the pain caused at this
    stage. At this time, if one presses the back of the right
    kidney with one's fingers, one can feel hard spots there.
    &quot;Johrei&quot; administered on these parts will dissipate
    the pain quite easily, and shortly after that the invalid
    will have a severe bowel movement and be completely cured.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">If anyone is attacked by appendicitis, and has
    no recourse to &quot;Johrei&quot;, he had better lie in his
    bed, and abstain from medical treatment. He is sure to be
    cured completely in a couple of days or a week at the longest.
    Needless to say, there is no danger to his life. In such a
    case, a doctor will probably advise instant surgery, or
    predict loss of life if his advice is not followed. From my
    standpoint, this is an inconceivable blunder on the part of
    the doctor.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">If the appendix is cut out, the toxin which
    should properly collect at the appendix must go to some other
    organ</font><font size="3">－</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">peritoneum or kidneys. This causes more serious
    diseases than appendicitis. Moreover, the disinfectant which
    is used during the operation is sure to dissolve someday, and
    then be excreted in pus. This causes various other diseases</font><font

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Medical science emphasizes the importance of
    nutrition as the cure of tuberculosis. However, the science
    of nutrition is also full of great mistakes, which I will now
    point out.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The greatest of its mistakes is that science
    takes only food as its object, and utterly neglects the
    organic function of the human body. For instance, it
    classifies vitamins into A, B, C, etc. and pretends it has
    made a great discovery. However, it makes no sense. It only
    exposes its ignorance of the basic truth. When a human body
    is suffering from a shortage of vitamins, it means that its
    organic function of producing or extracting vitamins has been
    weakened. The true cure resuscitates this weakened organic
    function.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Then, why has the organic function been
    weakened? It is because it is being obstructed by an obstacle.
    This is a collection of medicinal toxin. It may be likened to
    an idle man. Medical science is committing the mistake of
    giving money to this idle man and helping him to become more
    and more idle. Through the amount of artificial vitamins one
    takes, the vitamin-producing function of one's body is
    degenerated and one becomes weaker. Having become physically
    weaker, the purifying function of the body becomes weaker and
    symptoms of one's disease seem to have improved. Medical
    science mistakes this as the favorable effect of good
    nutrition. It is not only ignorant of the relation between
    man and food, it rather construes the relation in the
    opposite direction.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">All kinds of food necessary to sustain mankind
    are produced all over the world. God has distributed grain,
    vegetables, fishes and flesh of birds and animals, according
    to the regions, climates and tribes of man. All mankind
    should have sufficient nutrition by natural foods and
    maintain good health.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man is not aware of this simple truth; and being
    fascinated by the supposed magic of science, formed a
    mistaken branch of learning called dietetics. They are making
    themselves weaker, wasting much of their time and money.
    Their foolishness is beyond my understanding.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This is also true of mastication or the chewing
    of food. If it is masticated too well, the stomach has not
    need to work and it becomes weak. Then one loses one's
    appetite and takes digestives to further facilitate eating
    and digestion. This compensates for the lost appetite, but
    makes the stomach still weaker and causes one to suffer from
    gastroptosis or gastric ulcer. By the same reason, tubercular
    invalids also need not worry about nutrition but enjoy food
    as healthy people, and masticate it normally. Since olden
    times, men have been healthier who eat their food quicker.<br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I will now mention another mistake of this
    science of nutrition. Modern people are far from suffering a
    shortage of nutrition, they are rather suffering from
    excessive nutrition, compared with people of olden times. As
    nutrition requires a physical function, excessive nutrition
    weakens this function. To explain more thoroughly, food and
    medicine specially prepared for nutrition is so complete in
    itself that the complete physical demand of the stomach is
    not needed. Incomplete food demands more activity from the
    system and its relating functions, making man healthier.
    Man's vitality is generated by the activity from the system
    and its relating functions, making man healthier. Man's
    vitality is generated by the activity of physical organs.
    Epicureans are weak, and men who enjoy a plain diet are
    healthy. These are all caused by the same reason. Even
    tubercular invalids also had better take more of vegetable
    food.<br>
