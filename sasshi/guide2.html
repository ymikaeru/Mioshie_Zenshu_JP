    face="Arial">This pamphlet has been compiled to serve as a
    guide for those people who know nothing about World
    Messianity. Our religion differs so much from other religions
    that it can not be understood from the viewpoint of existing
    standards of religions in general. Herein lies the importance
    or significance of World Messianity.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">A religion, as with everything else, should have
    its particular mission for its contemporaries as well as for
    the future. Although truths are unchangeable, a religion
    should adapt itself to the change of ages; or rather, it
    should play the part of leading the thought of the times.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In this sense, all cultures and religions have
    to find different reasons for their existence with the change
    of ages. The reason for this is the progress and development
    of mankind. Religions which are suited to save primitive
    people are of no use to intellectual people of the present
    age.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">World Messianity differs from Shintoism,
    Buddhism and Christianity, but all of these are included;
    moreover, a science which is far in advance to any of our
    present age is also included in it. Our aim is to ameliorate
    culture by correcting its errors, and to bring about Paradise
    on Earth by expelling disease, poverty and strife from the
    world. We believe in every possibility of this realization.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Such an unprecedented project of salvation,
    however, is beyond mere human scope, therefore we can not but
    believe that there is a Divine Power guiding our work.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">What is the reason of the birth of our religion?
    Should we analyze modern culture, which is the asset of human
    endeavour of thousands of years, it may appear to be highly
    advanced, but to our great disappointment it is in actuality
    contrary to its appearance. I am discussing the spiritual
    side of culture. We find no progress. People in the olden
    times seem to have been rather superior to us in this phase.
    Should we measure good and evil in the minds of people of the
    present age, the indication will be, to our regret, more vice
    than virtue.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The unfavourable influence of degenerate human
    minds over human society surpasses imagination. Wars, which
    are the greatest causes of suffering of mankind, diseases,
    poverty, crime, and natural calamities are far from
    decreasing; rather are they increasing. It is quite
    incomprehensible why mental culture should lag so far behind
    scientific culture. However, not only has anyone ever
    questioned this fact, but all people are being infatuated
    with material culture and accelerating its progress. Why is
    it that religionists, scholars, statesmen and men of
    intellect are not aware of this discrepancy? There may be a
    few people who are aware of it, but they are ignorant of the
    fundamental principle. Therefore, they make the mistake of
    believing that human evil is the natural feature of humanity
    and acquiesce in the present status of human society.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man has most earnestly pursued happiness. They
    have tried every conceivable means to secure happiness. This
    can be seen in man's fervent dream of Utopia and yearning for
    an ideal world. They first depend upon religion in their
    pursuit of happiness, but as its attainment begins to appear
    uncertain, they seek it in other fields. This is the reason
    that education, moralism, and philosophy achieved remarkable
    progress in China and Europe. We may refer to, in China,
    Confucius, Menfucius and Chufucius; and in Europe, Socrates,
    Kant, and Hegel etc. as representative educators or
    philosophers. Needless to say, men looked upon them with
    great expectation.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In Europe, however, material science began to
    raise its head in the seventeenth century, and worked
    revolution in all phases of human activity. The most
    remarkable was the industrial revolution which was caused by
    the machine age. From this time onward, man was charmed by
    material science. Man began to think quite naturally, that
    religion or moralism was a roundabout means, and positive
    science a short-cut to secure happiness and an ideal world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In fact, countries with advanced science became
    thriving, powerful, and respected and feared by other
    countries. They were able to guarantee better living for
    their people; therefore, all other countries were forced to
    follow the example set by these countries. The result was the
    rapid progress of science, which finally has arrived at its
    present stage.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">But, man has been over-infatuated with science,
    and have completely ignored the spiritual side of humanity.
    Morals have degenerated, men are only pursuing the visible
    things, and unawares, they have become slaves to science.
    Man, who should control science is now being ruled by it. The
    world is now trembling at the menace of impending disaster.
    The future of mankind is very dark.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man first started in the pursuit of happiness
    and an ideal world, but they lost sight of their aim without
    being aware of it. They have been driven into a corner
    figuratively speaking. It is a great irony that the more
    advanced is their science, the further they are from
    happiness. In other words, man first tried to construct
    paradise with spiritual culture, but being disappointed in
    this method, they turned to thinking that science would bring
    about the desired result. So they did their best in their
    endeavour to advance science. However, the result of their
    endeavour is not Paradise. They have succeeded in producing
    something more horrible than the Inferno</font><font size="3">－</font><font
    size="3" face="Arial">destruction of mankind, which is meant
    by the invention of the atomic bomb.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man has never lived in a more perilous age;
    still they are not aware of their folly and they continue
    their worship of material science. In short, they once failed
    in spiritual culture, and they are now failing in material
    culture. They have not grown any wiser by these failures.
    This is the urgent problem of the whole of mankind. They
    should admit their mistakes and make a new start. They should
    build up a new culture, which is neutral, unbiased as to the
    spiritual or the material. This is the only way to realize
    Paradise on Earth.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is now the transitional period from the old
    culture to new culture. This is what I have frequently
    alluded to as the great transition of the world. Human
    history has never recorded such a great change. Of what type
    then will the new culture be which will supersede the old
    culture? Man, at the present level of his intellect, can
    never have a glimpse of it. What will be the new culture and
    who will create it? In this, all must acknowledge the
    existence of God.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I will now explain this. There are innumerable
    deities, who are divided into upper, middle and lower
    classes, performing various tasks. According to Shintoism,
    there are eight million deities. In the past, there have been
    two conflicting thoughts about God: Monotheism as in
    Christianity versus polytheism as in Shintoism. However, both
    have not been impartial. Actually, the only One True God
    divides His Spirit and appears as many deities; therefore, he
    is one God as well as many deities. This is the truth, and
    this is the conclusion I have reached from my study of the
    Divine World over many years.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is true that there were also a few people in
    the past who had thought similarly, but they could not
    explain their thoughts any further. It is also true that
    there are many instances of man worshipping deities of lower
    grades, mistaking them to be God.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Who is the Supreme Being? He is &quot;Su-shin&quot;
    or God, who is called by various names such as Jehova, Logos,
    Deus, Lord, God Everlasting, Reincarnated Christ, Messiah,
    etc. by various creeds or nations. The aim of God is to
    create an ideal world which is filed with truth, virtue and
    beauty. This necessarily had to take a long time because
    every condition must be fulfilled beforehand. The time has
    come. The whole of mankind should know this fact. It is
    urgent for man to accomplish the spiritual revolution.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I will mention proof which testifies that the
    time has come. It is the expression &quot;World State&quot;
    which has recently become of use in the United States of
    America. It may be needless to say that World State means an
    ideal world which has united all the countries of the world.
    This means that material civilization has reached the stage
    in which the ideal of World State has some possibility of
    realization. It is impossible to create Paradise, should the
    level of culture be very low, or the world be divided into
    many countries. If man has only restricted communication, the
    world will remain obscure and there will be no unification of
    thought.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">With the age of a new culture dawning upon us,
    it may be necessary for us to be acquainted with the outline
    of the divine project. God is going to develop His
    magnificent administration through the organ of one human
    being. I believe that I have been selected for this purpose.
    You may be now able to understand the reason of the birth of
    our religion.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As God reveals to me His plan of constructing
    Paradise on Earth, I am developing it as guided. That which
    is useful in the old culture will be preserved; that which is
    amendable will also be used in construction of new culture.
    This is the magnificent love of God. All others, alas, must
    perish. Is this anything but the Last Judgement?<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Materialists blame and attack me, calling me a
    heretic, whenever I make these revelations. It is not
    unreasonable for them to persecute me. Man has only
    experienced either spiritual or material culture, so it is
    natural that he can not easily understand the new culture,
    which is neutral, unbiased by either of the two. People who
    are inclined towards spiritual culture reproach the &quot;actual
    benefits&quot; professed by religion as if this were a sign
    of a meager religion which pursues only material advantages.
    According to them, such religions are only of the highest
    which seek the satisfaction of their souls. They are
    intoxicated with the difficult words of their scriptures.
    However, theoretical religions are not effective in salvation
    for the multitude.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">People on the side of materialism are leaning
    excessively toward the material. Anything is superstition to
    them which is not visible. Of course they have no room for
    belief in the existence of God. It is to my great regret that
    most of the Japanese people of the leading classes or the
    intelligent classes are of this type. Our religion is also a
    superstition to them, and they do not overlook every chance
    of attacking us orally or in writing. In extreme cases, they
    warn others against us. The general public is misled by them;
    people hesitate to study our religion, so they can not grasp
    its true feature. In this meaning, most of intelligent people
    are obstructing the progress of culture. This is the same
    everywhere in the world. Whenever, anything new is born, it
    is almost invariably opposed by the multitude. This is the
    sad destiny of all forerunners.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is interesting to note that any theory which
    is only a little above the level of the culture of the
    generation is welcomed and applauded by the intelligentsia.
    Theories of this type are most easily understandable to them
    who have received the education of the existing culture. Most
    of Nobel Prize winners are of this category. People will
    never understand any theory which is too far above or
    separated from the general level of the generation. They will
    look upon the originators of these theories as heretics; they
    will persecute them. Christ, Socrates, Copernicus, Galileo
    and Luther etc. were all persecuted as history tells us.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">My theory is far more unparalleled. It is
    advanced by one or two centuries ahead of the level of the
    present age. People who are being stuffed with existing
    cultures are only taken aback by my theory; they do not even
    try to study it; they define it as a superstition and try to
    destroy it. Should my theory have no other merit than that it
    is unprecedented, our religion would never have accomplished
    such a rapid development under the severe persecution of the
    intelligentsia and the government. There must be something in
    it. We have trod thorny paths, and have fought our way many
    times through oppression, but still our project of
    constructing Paradise on Earth is progressing unexpectedly
    well. There is something in it beyond human comprehension.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When any one is converted to World Messianity,
    he or she is endowed with a healing power which is favorably
    comparable to that which founders of other religions had. It
    is a matter of everyday practice for my followers to work
    miracles. By studying the doctrines of our religion, any
    follower can understand the secrets of life; will be awakened
    to truths; his daily life will be improved; he will become
    happier; he can fare the future with firm conviction; and can
    thus live a truly secured life.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In continuing to be a follower of our religion,
    his physiognomy will be improved. This is because his blood
    is purified and he becomes healthier. Any fear for his future
    will disappear; his character will be improved; he will
    become more trusted by others; he will thus become a man of
    virtue, loved and respected by all. The fundamental condition
    of realizing the motto of our religion</font><font size="3">－</font><font
    size="3" face="Arial">the construction of Paradise on earth</font><font
    size="3">－</font><font size="3" face="Arial">is the
    improvement of individuals, qualifying them to be inhabitants
    of Paradise. As the number of these individuals increase,
    Paradise on Earth will draw nearer its realization, because
    the world is nothing but a group consisting of individuals.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">From what necessity does man exist in this
    world? Who created man? These questions will come first to
    any thinking person. Unless they are answered, the solution
    of any other arduous problems may be of no use. These
    problems are only a source of headache and can never support
    man spiritually in his struggle.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">One and all have adored culture, science, etc.,
    but these have explained nothing about man. Darwin wrote the
    &quot;Origin of the Species.&quot; According to his book, the
    ancestors of man were amoeba. So far, so good, but the rest
    is shocking. Amoeba successively evolved into reptiles,
    dinosaurs, apes, anthropoids, and then into man. Should this
    theory be true, the apes which are to be found in the jungles
    of Africa are on the threshold of becoming men. However, we
    have never heard of such reports. Then the famous theory of
    evolution seems to be a questionable one.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man was not born because he wished to be born.
    His parents simply begot him without actual intention. As a
    man grows older and begins to understand the common
    occurrences in the world, what he wishes to know is why man
    is born. Besides the evolution theory, there are some
    religious theories which intend to explain the reason why man
    is born into the world, but they are too ambiguous.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man must eat to continue to exist, and ample
    food is provided for him. His food is obtained from the land
    and sea. Also, there is nothing useless in this world. Should
    there be anything which is considered useless, it is because
    man does not know its use or man's knowledge has not
    developed enough to recognize its use.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Something or Somebody has directed man to make
    use of the resources in the world and great advance has
    resulted, which is in evidence around us. It is obvious, or
    should be so, that this Somebody desires to use man as an
    instrument to create a better world. There can not he any
    other way of thinking. What we can do is only to bow our
    heads respectfully to this Somebody, who can manipulate our
    lives as He Wills.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">However, man is a troublesome creature enough
    and can never agree with anything which he does not
    understand. He invented learning to refine his wisdom. The
    process of this learning was that there had been the
    invisible Creator at the beginning, who made everything in
    this world. But gradually man started to say that he could no
    more believe in anything invisible. Therefore, he thus worked
    up a complicated thing which he called science. This was
    definitely visible or tangible. He was very proud of his
    invention, and has been enslaved by this science ever since.
    Under the spell of science man came to have quite a conceit
    with his superficial knowledge acquired from Nature.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As they have thus worshipped science more than
    God, they ought to have remodelled their society into a very
    pleasant one by their science. Far contrary to their
    expectation, the whole of mankind is now trembling at the
    products of their science. God, seeing their consternation,
    can not be entirely undisturbed, because men are all His
    children. From His Divine Mercy, therefore, He has appointed
    me to found World Messianity to propagate the divine truth
    and open their eyes.<br>
    Man is in a great dilemma. Although science has given him
    many convenient devices, it has never produced the most
    important item</font><font size="3">－</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">the security of man's mind. This has caused a
    disappointment to man, but being accustomed to his adoration
    of science, he still clings to it with greater tenacity.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Science itself is a good mechanism, given man to
    increase their happiness. Good men, therefore, wish to make a
    good use of it to make a happier world; but the wicked desire
    to exploit it. Therefore, a constant struggle occurs in which
    the masses are always the victims.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I will now write about the creation of the
    universe. At the beginning, in the center of the void, there
    was the Creator, who created such substances as now make up
    the universe.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When the earth was fresh from the Creator's
    hands, it was soft. It gradually hardened; separating earth
    and water, which developed into land and sea. However, as the
    land was still too soft, the Creator then produced the only
    animals which could live on the earth such as dinosaurs and
    mammoths etc. </font><font size="3"><br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">When the land had
    fairly hardened, all the monstrous animals had fulfilled
    their use and were dismissed. This was the natural selection.
    The Creator produced insects, birds, beasts, and reptiles; He
    also created trees and grasses, rocks and minerals; and after
    all conditions were completed, He created man as His last
    work.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man was created naked; and his ingenuity caused
    him to utilize what was available around him to clothe and
    house himself. As man was incessantly attacked by beasts, he
    made weapons of various kinds. As he became more adept, he
    produced better weapons with which he was able to subjugate
    most of the animals. This was also the natural selection.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man however, would not be satisfied. The more
    greedy among them now began to desire more land, property,
    and women; and this was the beginning of man's struggle. We
    can hardly find a more ignoble being than man in this sense.
    Every one of them has struggled to overpower others of their
    kind. Machines for slaughter were more and more improved; and
    finally the atomic bomb was invented. Man is now appalled at
    his own invention.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Creator has now decided that it is time to
    check the development of destructive science. Should man be
    permitted to develop this science any further, they will ruin
    their civilization and they must return to their former
    barbarism. He considers that the world is now civilized
    enough to be converted into the Paradise which He has planned
    from the beginning. He did not interfere with wars because
    they were necessary. Had it not been for wars, the progress
    of culture would not have been so rapid. He has prepared
    everything necessary for this construction.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">According to the Creator, man should have known
    the advent of such a Paradise, because he once caused Christ
    and Buddha to prophesy it.<br>

    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It has always been the mistaken conception that
    the human body is a vessel for diseases. Nothing is more
    absurd. This ought to be corrected; the human body is a
    vessel for health.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There is a reason for the origin of the above
    erroneous thought. Man has suffered from diseases very
    frequently. He has taken cold, has suffered from headache or
    stomach-ache, diarrhea and other pains and discomforts in the
    normal course of events, and also is prone to many other
    sicknesses.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">He is shocked to have any of these troubles and
    consults doctors or takes medicines. In some cases, he is
    easily cured. But, sometimes, he is not so easily cured of
    even what he has considered to be a simple cold. Before long
    he may happen to suffer from such serious diseases as
    meningitis, typhus or pneumonia. He must consider himself
    fortunate if he is cured of these diseases, because it is not
    seldom that man loses his life by them. Physicians do not
    have any definite foresight in regards the condition of their
    patients; they can only rely upon supposition. Medical
    science is not yet so far advanced as to be able to give any
    precise diagnosis.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Those mentioned are all acute diseases. With
    diseases of the chronic type, especially with tuberculosis,
    patients are not cured for many years. If they happen to
    recover, they often suffer from a relapse. In repeating both
    recovery and relapse, they must suffer for a long time. Some
    of them may be cured by chance, but others must die after
    they have spent much money and experienced long suffering. As
    these patients become accustomed to medical treatment, they
    can never break away from it. In addition to their disease,
    they must also suffer from economical inconveniences, and
    salaried workers must lose their jobs.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Modern people, therefore, are extremely afraid
    of diseases. Both the government and the people are spending
    enormous sums of money every year for the prevention of
    diseases and the maintenance of medical facilities. The
    government has recently decided the appropriation of 8,700
    million yen for anti-tuberculosis campaign. Notwithstanding
    the united efforts of government and people, however,
    tuberculosis is not indicating any sign of decrease. The same
    can be said of all other diseases.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Typhus, dysentery, meningitis and other diseases
    are now rampant. There are so many patients that all
    hospitals are full, and not a small number of patients can
    not be hospitalized because of insufficient accommodation.
    The supply of medicines also seems to be very unsatisfactory.
    Despite these efforts, the number of patients does not
    decrease; every one of modern people, therefore, is suffering
    from disease phobia. This is the reason they still have such
    a saying that the human body is a vessel for diseases.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As soon as any person becomes a follower of our
    religion, he will easily be cured of his disease. His health
    will be improved and he need not fear any disease in future.
    Any epidemic diseases are also trifles, because they are the
    easiest to cure. He need not fear bacilli any more. When only
    this one fact is considered, that this is the miracle of the
    age which will bring happiness everywhere in the world, will
    be recognized.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Moreover, all followers are instructed in my
    method of curing the sick. This is a very effective method;
    so effective that you may hardly believe it. People who have
    heard about it may say that as even medical specialists who
    have studied for many years in colleges and clinics find it
    very difficult to cure patients of their sickness, it is
    absurd that laymen who have studied my method for only three
    to six months can cure seriously sick people who have been
    given up by specialists as incurable.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As far as a man is truly healthy, no bacilli can
    make him sick. The fact that the same bacilli make some
    people sick while not others, is because men of true health
    have higher resistance to bacilli. I think the progress of
    medical science or sanitation should properly turn their
    attention to producing more people with higher resistance. I
    wonder why it is that no one has realized this simple truth.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The social system of the present age has been
    fabricated upon the groundwork of modern culture, which is
    materialistic, biased, and reactional to spirit culture.
    Every detail of our social structure is founded on the
    prejudice that this is the best form of culture man can
    attain. It is therefore very natural that our social system
    has many defects, which have chiefly been caused by the
    discrepancies between materialistic culture and neutral
    culture. The most serious mistake of materialistic culture is
    that it ignores results, only emphasizing processes or
    methods. This is the point which is most incomprehensible.
    Should you analyze modern culture from this viewpoint, you
    can very clearly understand its merits as well as its
    weaknesses.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The most outstanding characteristic of
    materialism is its near-sightedness. It takes into
    consideration only things which are at hand. If a man has a
    fever, he seeks to lower it with ice-packs. He ignores the
    fact that there is some reason for his having a fever.
    Medical treatment is only concerned with the symptoms which
    appear on the surface.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is the same with relief movements, like the
    Feather Campaign, which raises funds to relieve the
    distressed.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Although their cause may be admirable, they are
    missing the vital point. Unhappy people are the result of a
    defective social structure. So there is no other solution to
    this problem than to correct the defect. All other methods
    are as ineffective as allopathic treatment for sick patients.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I have mentioned only two instances, but
    materialistic culture has defects in all of its phases.
    Modern people boast that they have a highly civilized
    culture, but their world is filled with unhappy people. The
    cause lies in its internal defects.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">God intends to awaken as many people as possible
    to the truth, and that as soon as possible. He is going to
    construct a truly happy human society which will finally
    develop into the Ideal World, where we shall not have any
    sick, poor people or wars. How magnanimous is providence!
    Some people may wonder why God did not reveal His Divine
    project earlier to man. They will understand the reason by
    becoming and continuing to be followers of World Messianity <br>

    size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Revolutionary Method of
    Agriculture<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Since about fifteen years ago I have been
    advocating a method of agriculture called Natural Cultivation
    in which crops can be greatly increased without the use of
    chemical fertilizer or manure.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">At first no farmer would listen to my advice
    although I earnestly tried to get them to adopt my method. In
    my firm belief that my method is based on the absolute truth,
    and that the time must come when they would recognize the
    merit of my method, and that not only farmers would not be
    saved, but the fate of this country would be adversely
    affected unless they adopted my method of cultivation, I have
    continued my efforts of advocating this method irregardless
    of persecution. Unfortunately, as my misgivings have come to
    realization, I feel strongly that the Japanese people in
    general as well as farmers should be persuaded of the true
    merit of my method. Perceiving that the future of Natural
    Cultivation is hopeful, we have begun to propagate this
    method.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As I am a religionist, many farmers who are my
    followers have put my method into practice, at the same time
    doubting its efficacy. The result was fairly excellent,
    therefore there appeared not a few sympathizers, and recently
    farmers who are not my followers have begun to pay attention.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Now let me explain the principle of Natural
    Cultivation by which crops are greatly increased without the
    aid of chemical fertilizer or manure.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Should this method be continued for five years,
    crops win be increased 50% all over the country. This may be
    difficult to believe in.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Now the yearly crop of rice in Japan amounts to
    63,000,000 koku (One koku equals about 4.96 bushels), and so,
    if this is increased by 50% it will amount to 94,500,000 koku.
    This amount is enough to feed all the Japanese people and
    still about 10,000,000 koku will remain. This will make the
    exportation of rice possible. Besides, the money which is
    usually spent on chemical fertilizer or manure is saved, the
    harm done by insects and storm is reduced, and labour is also
    reduced. This is such an astonishing method of agriculture.
    This is the effect of Natural Cultivation on rice crops, and
    it is also equally as effective on other agricultural
    products.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As for vegetables, for example sweet potatoes,
    astonishingly large potatoes are produced by this method.
    Potatoes of between four and five pounds weight are not
    uncommon. The total amount of the produce is twice as much as
    produced by using fertilizer. As for beans, these also grow
    bigger and are increased in amount and about three times as
    much are produced. In regards such vegetables as turnips,
    white and red radishes, etc., the taste is much improved. For
    greenstuffs the colour is much improved and free from insect
    damage, and the taste is improved. The same effect is
    produced in corn, squash, watermelon and others.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The characteristic of foodstuff by Natural
    Cultivation is deliciousness. Once one has known the taste of
    rice, wheat or vegetables grown by Natural Cultivation, one
    is sure to dislike those which have been grown by the
    conventional method. I am daily taking food which is only
    produced by Natural Cultivation, and fortunately the farmers
    who are practising Natural Cultivation are increasing, and so
    I am daily presented with more than sufficient farm products
    grown by my method.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Fruit crops are also yearly increasing and their
    quality is being improved since growers have stopped using
    fertilizers.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Flowers and blooms are also improved and their
    colours improved, also being stronger, they live longer when
    cut.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Another characteristic of Natural Cultivation is
    that it remarkably reduces the harm done by insects. Insects
    thrive from taking nourishment from fertilizers, so the
    abolition of the use of fertilizers causes plant insects to
    cease to exist.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Now, insecticides and disinfectants are widely
    used, but these penetrate into soil and become the cause of
    the appearance of plant insects.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Recently the yearly damage caused by storms is
    severe, but by Natural Cultivation, we can reduce this to
    negligible damage. The reason is that because the crops which
    absorb the fertilizers become very weak, that is, fertilizers
    whether chemical or manure, once absorbed in the crops,
    become poisonous and become food for plant insects making
    them thrive. Very small insects appear from some kinds of
    fertilizers feeding on the crops, or if they appear on the
    roots they eat the hair roots and weaken the plants. The
    reason why plants wither, stems break, flowers fall, fruit
    does not ripen, and potatoes decrease in size is because of
    those small insects. The crops in their healthy condition
    have the strength to exterminate those insects, but crops
    weakened by fertilizers can not withstand the harm done by
    those insects.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">By Natural Cultivation, we can reduce crop
    damage to a negligible amount. When blown by a storm, the
    crops grown by my method are very strong and do not bow to
    the wind, or should they bow, their resilience is powerful,
    while crops grown by fertilizers remain bent and so the
    damage is big. The reason is that the hair roots of the crops
    grown by my method are much longer and more numerous than the
    roots of crops grown by the use of fertilizers, and so the
    strength of the roots to support the stems are much stronger.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is important to know the characteristic of
    productivity of soil. Soil is the thing created by God to
    produce things to feed man and beast. Therefore, the soil is
    naturally abundant with nourishment for plant life, or it is
    nourishment itself for plant life. Being ignorant of the
    above-stated truth, man has mistakenly used fertilizers. As a
    result, the original power of the soil has been unexpectedly
    weakened. The character of the Japanese soil has been said to
    be acid. It is because fertilizers have been used for years.
    Therefore, also to increase crops, we must increase the life-giving
    power of the soil. For that purpose one has to keep the soil
    pure, without using impurities apart from vegetable manure
    heaps. This simple method produces wonderful and gratifying
    effects.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The fundamental idea of Natural Cultivation is
    the estimation of nature. Every creature in the world is
    grown by the three elements</font><font size="3">－</font><font
    size="3" face="Arial">Fire, Water, and Soil. Crops are no
    exception. And so, enough sunshine, water supply, and
    purified soil produce abundant crops for man. The effect of
    the vegetable manure heaps is not nourishment, but to keep
    the soil moist, warm, and soft, that is, they absorb water
    and heat and keep the soil soft.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In the center of the earth there is a huge mass
    of fire which is constantly sending heat or &quot;spirit of
    earth&quot; upwards, this is nothing but nitrogen. This
    nitrogen is the natural fertilizer which God has given us and
    it penetrates the surface of the earth, ascends to a certain
    height, then comes down with the rain and is absorbed into
    the earth. Thus it becomes the natural fertilizer, the amount
    of which is not too much nor too small. Artificial nitrogen
    gives only a temporary effect and not a lasting effect. Too
    much artificial nitrogen weakens the natural power of the
    soil and reduces the crops accordingly.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">From every viewpoint, the supreme effectiveness
    of my Natural Cultivation method will be clearly understood.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The gravest problem of people in the world
    today, is how to attain happiness.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Man is necessarily occupied with this thought
    from the cradle to the grave. Cynically enough, that which
    man is most anxious to know is usually most difficult to know.
    This problem is no exception to the rule. I am fortunate
    enough to know the answer to this problem. My knowledge is
    unerring because it is based on practical experience. The
    definition of fortune is not easy as it is so vague. One can
    not change one's fortune. The only thing one can do is to
    leave one's fortune to take its own course.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is very difficult even for the greatest man
    in the world to swallow his lot. As a result, the ardent
    desire for happiness is a stimulant to life, which makes one
    toil and struggle to earn money, or attain distinction
    through life, to no avail.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There is nothing more contrary than human
    fortune, which is too elusive to catch. A chance to become
    happy must be seized at the instant it appears, otherwise it
    escapes.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Through various experiences, I once felt as
    though I were being mocked by good fortune, but now I know I
    have been blessed with good fortune.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This is very difficult to explain to non-followers,
    who are inclined to judge things superficially without
    looking into the core. When a person is not able to penetrate
    into the core of good fortune, he is unable to understand
    what fortune actually is.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When man moves, it is not his body that moves of
    its own motivation, but his mind which moves the body. The
    same principle is applicable to fortune. The universe is
    composed of the phenomenal side and the invisible spiritual
    side. Such is the way in which God has created the universe.
    The spiritual side of the world moves the phenomenal or
    physical side of the world just as the mind moves the body.
    And in every case, the spiritual world precedes the
    phenomenal or real world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">So, fortune follows the same rule; that is, one
    can become happy only when the spiritual side of oneself in
    the spiritual world has become happy. One's happy condition
    in the spiritual world reflects upon the physical world to
    make one happy in this world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In the spiritual world, the class system is more
    strict and impartial than in this world. It is divided into
    three strata, the upper, middle and lower, each stratum being
    again subdivided into sixty divisions. Therefore, it has one
    hundred and eighty divisions in total. The upper stratum
    corresponds to heaven, the lower to hell, and the middle to
    purgatory, the condition of which is approximately the same
    with that of this world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This may be inconceivable to modern people. This
    fact, however, is unerring and has been revealed to me by
    God, and is based on my own thorough and long investigation
    into the relation between the spiritual world and the
    physical world. The numerous people who have become happy
    through having faith and practising my teaching based on this
    revelation prove the genuineness of the fact.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The spiritual side of man resides in the
    spiritual world, whereas the physical side of man lives in
    this physical world. The spiritual side of man, or his soul,
    stays in one of the one hundred and eighty divisions, that
    is, he is spiritually domiciled in that position in the
    spiritual world. This spiritual domicile is not settled but
    always moving upward or downward. This movement influences
    man's fortune to make him happier or unhappier. Man should,
    therefore try to uplift his spiritual domicile as much as
    possible.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The lower part of the spirit world is hell, of
    course, a pandemonium full of every kinds of agony, a dark
    lightless world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The higher one's soul goes, the better the
    condition becomes. The upper part is heavenly, peaceful and
    bright. An ideal world. The condition of the middle part is
    neither very good nor very bad.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Thus, it is quite clear that to lift the
    position of one's soul in the spirit world is basically the
    most important thing to become happy, when one's domicile in
    the spiritual world is reflected upon one's fortune in this
    world to make him happier or unhappier.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There are some persons who, having succeeded in
    life and been envied by many, suddenly fell in their
    circumstances to their original condition in spite of their
    expectation in continuity of success. The cause of their fall
    is attributable to their too strong self-confidence,
    negligence of God and ignorance of the above-stated fact.
    Besides, those people are inclined to afflict others and
    attempt the impossible. In consequence, they may phenomenally
    succeed in life, but their souls are then already in hell.
    The condition of their souls in hell is reflected upon them
    in time, finally making their lot hellish by the law of
    &quot;spirit preceding body&quot;.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Vicious deeds make one's soul cloudy, whereas
    virtuous deeds make one's soul pure enough to ascend upward.
    The secret to attain happiness is, therefore, to avoid all
    vice, do good as far as one can, and thus try to make one's
    soul as pure as possible.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I affirm that this is the truth and that there
    is no other way to become truly happy. I know it is much
    easier to preach than to practise. There is one way, however,
    to make its practice easy</font><font size="3">－</font><font

    through my followers, hundreds and thousands of critical
    invalids have been saved, and they have become able to work
    in good health. Since olden times, life has been considered
    to be at the mercy of destiny; and the progress of culture or
    medical science could do nothing about it. But now the
    extension of life which is the greatest desire of the whole
    of mankind has become possible. What a great joy this must be
    to people who can understand and believe. However, should
    ordinary people become acquainted with this fact, through
    lectures or publications of our organization, it is natural
    that they will find it difficult to believe.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">All people are pursuing happiness. However,
    should a man lack health, all other conditions of happiness
    which he may have are equal to nothing. Christ well said that

    bring to him if he injure his life? There is nothing more

    religion are in the publications of our organization. These
    persons have been saved not only from diseases, but some of

    face="Arial">My power of salvation is exercised through
    hundreds and thousands of my disciples who are working
    innumerable miracles every day. We have had several great
    religionists or sages in the past. But there is a great
    difference between what they accomplished and what I am doing
    now. It has been a question of time that we may see the
    second advent of Christ or the reincarnation of Buddha.
    Prophecies which man has made since thousands of years ago
    will be fulfilled.<br>

    messiah, because I have never considered myself to be great.
    It was merely that I was inflamed with love for mankind when
    I was young, and desired to become a religionist and save
    people. After completing a certain amount of ascetic
    practices, I received a revelation and was endowed with a
    great spiritual power.<br>

    mankind, I am now executing the Divine project as a proxy of
