    size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Truth, Virtue, Beauty<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Earthly Paradise, our ideal, is a world
    where truth, virtue and beauty shall reign supreme.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Let us explain the meaning of the above more
    fully.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">First, on truth. This means, of course,
    realization of the truth, and truth is things as they really
    are without even the slightest deviation. However, in
    civilization to date, things which are not the truth have
    been taken for the truth, that is, so many pseudo-truths have
    passed current with the world as the truths. The reason why
    people have not noticed their error is that the level of
    science in general has been too low.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The situation of the modern world in which
    people only toil and struggle to earn their livelihood with
    no definite hope, testifies to the above fact. They proudly
    allude to the advanced civilized world in spite of the fact
    that they live under the menace of disease, hard living
    conditions and war.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">From an impartial viewpoint, the modern phase of
    life in which people are at variance with each other, quarrel
    with each other, devote themselves to strife, thus struggling
    in the vortex of uneasiness and irritation, is just brutal.
    This has resulted from the civilization in which pseudo
    truths dominate. It is very pitiful that even intelligentsia
    can not recognize their errors, believe the modern world as
    &quot;civilized&quot; and sing in praise of it.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In regards disease, the world is filled with the
    sick, because medical science is deviated front the truth.
    Why does there exist innumerable sorts of disease, e.g.,
    tuberculosis, dysentery, Japanese encephalitis B, apoplectic
    stroke, polio, and so on? One excuse for this is as follows:
    there existed many types of diseases in the olden times, but
    they were not classified because of lack of advancement of
    medical science, but now, advanced science has made it
    possible to discern each kind of disease.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Be that as it may, the only hope is to decrease
    the sick and increase the healthy in number.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Modern people fear disease to such an extent
    that medical specialists as well as the government
    authorities feel very nervous about hygiene, and are making
    strenuous effort in the prevention of diseases. One method is
    by injection of drugs, which, I think, is rather pathetic.
    Injection of drugs in general will not cure disease, but only
    relieve patients temporarily. Thus medical science, can not
    even tell the difference between temporary relief and
    fundamental cure. If they did know it, they would not be able
    to know how to cure. Medical specialists only seek to halt
    the outward symptoms of disease and believe that it testifies
    to the progress of medical science.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It may be beyond their imagination that the very
    method used in halting the symptoms of disease is nothing but
    the cause of successive diseases. Thus, it is quite natural
    that the more medical science advances, the more the number
    of the sick increase. Take the present situation of the world
    in which the sick keep increasing and the general tendency of
    health conditions is on the down-slope. Hence, people are
    afraid of fatigue and insufficient sleep, loss of stamina,
    they can not overtax themselves and are exhausted quickly by
    excessive physical exercise.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Physical exercise or sports which are recently
    being encouraged will also be in vain as a method to promote
    health. Not a few athletes are short lived.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Those who adhere to the principle of the
    pathology which the Church of World Messianity advocates, and
    receive &quot;Johrei&quot; or Soul Purification Treatment,
    will be released from the curse of disease and enjoy health
    in the true sense of the word. Innumerable instances testify
    to the genuineness of this.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As for virtue, it is contrary to vice. Vice
    originated from atheism which is a product of materialism,
    while virtue originated from theism. This is the truth.
    Increase of vice accompanies the progress of science, and so
    to speak, progress of civilization is just superficial as the
    general tendency of science is inclined to deny theism. Vice
    which accompanies the progress of science should not be
    thought little of although the merit of science can not be
    denied.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Scientists, being ignorant of this, only praise
    the meritorious side of science, and as to the harmful side
    of it, they have their own excuses, thus captivating the mind
    of intelligentsia and causing them to believe that science
    alone is capable of solving every problem.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">This has led people away from attaining
    spiritual happiness.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Next comes beauty. It is a very good tendency
    indeed that the element of beauty has come to occupy greater
    part in our civilization in accord with the progress of
    culture, but the mass of the people are not able to
    participate in the enjoyment of beauty. The multitude are
    fully occupied in struggling to live whereas only a
    privileged class of people are enjoying the pleasures that
    beauty can bring.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Far from enjoying beauty, the masses can only
    obtain the necessities of life, especially so in Japan. Thus
    it is almost impossible for them to enjoy the beauty of
    nature which is the great bounty of God, and art which is man-made
    beauty.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is not the whole people of the world who can
    share in the benefit of the advanced civilization, but only a
    part of them. So this world is heavenly only for the rich
    while it is miserable for the poor. It follows therefore that
    there must be something wrong with the modern culture. The
    world will become a true civilized world when its fault has
    been rectified and all the people impartially are able to
    enjoy happiness.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The mission of the Church of World Messianity is
    to realize such a civilized world in its truest sense. Now, I
    think, the meaning of &quot;truth, virtue and beauty&quot;
    has been clearly defined. The question is the power to
    realize fulfilment. An ideal is futile if it is not realized.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">However, the time has come when such an ideal is
    to be realized on earth.<br>
    <br>

    size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Mission of Art<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Everything in this world has its own mission
    which renders its service to human society. This is what is
    called the &quot;Mission of Heaven.&quot;<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Of course, art is also placed under this
    category. Those engaged in art, therefore, must be conscious
    of their mission of heavenly gift and fulfil it completely.
    Therein lies &quot;art&quot; in its true sense, and at the
    same time it is what an artist really is.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">However, regrettable is the fact that artists in
    general of the present day are deviating too far from the
    right path though some of them, are undoubtedly artists in
    the true sense.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">For the most part, artists have forgotten their
    own mission </font><font size="3">－</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">or it may be rather proper to say that they have
    never borne it in mind. Despite this, they consider
    themselves to be a special sort of people in society, and
    behave as they please in the belief that it is a display of
    individuality and also a manifestation of genius to act so.
    This is, indeed, a matter for regret.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Be that as it may, the responsibility is partly
    found on the part of society. It must be remembered that such
    degradation of artists is caused by the fact that society has
    treated them as people of a special class, and overlook their
    faults.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">To speak orthodoxically, those who are called
    artists must originally have a nobler character than ordinary
    people. This will be understandably accounted for from the
    religious point of view.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Historical facts reveal that the primitive age
    was characterized by brutality, which constituted most of the
    element of mankind. We wonder if there is any one who doubts
    that &quot;ideal culture&quot; has been in the process of
    construction through all stages from these barbaric times. In
    view of this, development or culture is nothing but the
    removing of brutality from human beings, which will pave the
    way for the civilized world in the true sense of the words.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is deplorable, however, that most of human
    beings are still exposed to the menace of war. This is
    because brutality still remains as an element within them. To
    assume one of the important duties to remove this brutality
    is the very task imposed upon artists.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Accordingly, the primary mission of an artist is
    to raise the spiritual character of all human beings. Its
    object will be attained through the means of literature,
    paintings, music, plays, etc. It is that the spirit of an
    artist appeals to the public through the offices of such
    mediums. To speak plainly, the inspiration from the spirit of
    an artist awakes the responsive cord in the heart of the
    masses through literature, paintings, music and the art of
    the dance etc. Eventually it will mean the linking of the
    spirit of an artist and that of the masses.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Therefore, it the character of an artist is low,
    the effect upon the people is also relative. It is also quite
    natural that if the character of an artist is high, the
    sentiment of the public should be uplifted also. That is why
    art is valuable. In short, an artist is a leader of the
    masses who should be guided to a better and finer realization
    of life through art. <br>

    size="4" face="Arial"><strong>A Remark on Art<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The tendency of art in general, especially
    paintings of the modern school, is drifting away from the
    true mission wherein art should lie. Painters are neglecting
    for the most part this all important mission.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Artists should be aware of the significance of
    their existence. Their duty is to elevate people to a higher
    spiritual level. To elevate the human mind to a more
    virtuous, beautiful condition. This is the mission of
    painting in its truest sense. Free exertion of a personality,
    or volition for purposes of creation, or free choice of
    subjects are quite all right, but beyond a certain
    limitation, they make no sense.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In modern paintings, there are many pictures
    which are so grotesque that we can not find even a trace of
    beauty in them, and so deformed that they are even offending.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Such paintings are not an expression of
    personality, they are rather a means of forcing sales. The
    effect of such pictures is far from elevating spiritually. It
    is interesting to note that painters of such pictures are
    usually in needy circumstances, despite their efforts, and
    suffering from dire poverty, and without contributing to the
    world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Above is my opinion on modern painting, and
    there are not a few people who agree with this opinion and
    criticize similarly. The true life or painting is elegance
    and tone. Such elements are scarcely contained in modern
    painting.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Whenever I see masterpieces of Chinese or
    Japanese paintings, I am struck with their high tone. Modern
    Japanese painters are almost indifferent to this quintessence
    of Eastern painting. We can find this quintessence in the
    paintings by old masters, but young painters seem to follow
    in the wake of the modern school.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The true significance of art in general,
    including Japanese painting or Western painting, is this; to
    deepen man's intelligence and lead his soul to a higher level
    by conveying the author's spirit through the senses. If its
    purpose is only to amuse, then it can not be said to be art.
    The same thing can be applicable to fine art, literature,
    music, drama, the dance etc. To appeal to the popular mind
    through art, eliminate brutality from man's character, and to
    make man more civilized in the true sense, these are raison
    d'etre of art. The more objectivity an art object has,
    therefore, the more valuable it is as such. However high
    value an author attaches to his own work, it is valueless if
    it does not pass current with the world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Let us look at the great works by the great
    masters since olden times. Their divine skill which is so
    comprehensive that it amuses and charms the intelligentsia as
    well as the multitude is vividly alive still today.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Most modern art is a food which is tasty and
    without nutrition. A show which only satisfies one's passing
    interest. Such art only serves to deteriorate people's
    character.<br>
    <br>

    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The common idea that religion and art are almost
    alien to each other is erroneous. The mission of art is to
    created nobler sentiment in people, make their life more
    significant and have them enjoy their life. It gives us
    inexpressible pleasure to see flowers in spring, crimson
    foliage in autumn, beautiful scenery of mountains and sea,
    and enjoy literary works or art objects.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Earthly Paradise, the realization of which
    we aim at, is a world of art or a world where truth, virtue
    and beauty dominate. Thus art is a realized form of beauty.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Why is it that art has been neglected by
    religionists to date? The genius of some high priests in the
    olden times towards beauty had so full swing that they
    painted, engraved, and planned the architecture of temples.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">One of the most excellent religious artists was
    Prince Shotoku. All may agree with my opinion that the
    architecture of the Horyuji Temple at Nara, planned by Prince
    Shotoku, or paintings and sculptures contained in it are so
    splendid, that the fact that it was built about one thousand
    two hundred years ago is almost unimaginable.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">On the other hand, however, there were many
    saints and great priests who have propagated teachings, being
    content with coarse clothing and poor food, thus leading an
    ascetic life. This fact has given birth to the common idea
    that art and religion are merely distantly related. Their
    lives may have been dominated by truth and virtue, but were
    lacking in beauty.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In such a sense, I shall advocate the necessity
    of art.<br>
    <br>
    </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="3" face="Arial"><br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="4"><strong>　　　</strong></font><font
    size="4" face="Arial"><strong>Artistic Religion<br>
    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Since olden times, art has been deemed as
    something apart from religion. However, the origin of art in
    Japan was Buddhistic art. The keynote of Buddhistic art is
    simple in its character. For example, painting, sculpture and
    textile fabric are most simple, and as for music, musical
    instruments are simple and the melodies played by them are
    also very simple. Then stimulated by Chinese and Korean art
    which were later imported, unique Japanese art was created
    after the period of imitative art. With the importation of
    Western culture, Western art also came in. Especially, after
    the Meiji Era, Japan became flooded with the art of Europe
    and America. So in the modern artistic world of Japan, was
    created a synthetic art by digesting masterpieces of Western
    Countries. In such sense, Japan may be called a department
    store of world culture.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There will be and has been no religion in the
    world which estimates art in general so highly as the Church
    of World Messianity. The Earthly Paradise which World
    Messianity is aiming at is a world of art. As the Earthly
    Paradise is a world free from disease, poverty and strife and
    where truth, virtue and beauty dominate, in such a world, men
    follow the truth, detest vice and thus, everything in that
    world is beautified. As a result, people become fond of art
    and their life is filled with art. Art prospers and makes all
    the world artistic, or the world of art.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Therefore, I am most interested in art, and
    shall patronize art. As its first step, I have built the
    miniature Earthly Paradise at Gohra, Hakone.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Although there are many celebrated gardens in
    Japan which have their individual characteristics, they are
    not so remarkable for their uniqueness. However, I believe
    the Shinsenkyo is an exception.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">An astonishing amount of rocks and stone of
    strange shapes were dug from around the vicinity, and I
    arranged these without following the traditional make-up of
    the typical Japanese garden in order to create an utterly new
    form following divine guidance. I have also collected various
    kinds of trees to create a harmonious effect. As for the
    streams and falls, I have tried to produce the merit of
    natural art, intensifying their natural flavour and tying the
    beauty of nature with that of the garden. Thus, I have tried
    to awaken the idea of beauty in man's mind through the joy
    which a beautiful garden brings.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Whether the garden is looked at close up, from a
    distance, partly or in whole, each case presents a different
    aspect. In the course of time, the various kinds of moss,
    small grasses, flowers or small trees which are peculiar to
    Hakone, have grown in the hollows of the rocks and recently
    the garden has acquired a look of age which has added to its
    beauty.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The charm of the garden gives one a feeling of
    attachment to the locality. Following the rain one is
    fascinated by the noise of the meandering mountain streams.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The two falls of the stream represent well the
    harmonious beauty of nature and art and has been a source of
    satisfaction to me. One may be reminded in gazing at them of
    mountain recesses or dark valleys. The crimson foliage around
    is in good contrast with the falls, and there is depth in
    general tone of the setup.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It may sound not a little conceited to praise
    that which I have constructed myself, but actually this is
    not so. Although l made the garden. God made it beautiful,
    and I am singing in the praise or God.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The museum which has recently been completed
    adds to the beauty of the garden. Part of the art objects
    exhibited in it are my own collection, but I have checked up
    on the national treasures owned by other museums, personal
    collections and art objects in temples in Japan and intend to
    exhibit them at some time in our museum. My plan is to
    exhibit the new as well as the masterpieces of Eastern art by
    the masters of each period, chiefly from the aesthetic point
    of view. Only a small part will be chosen from the historical
    and archaeological point of view.<br>

    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The model Earthly Paradise at Momoyama, Atami
    which is under construction, was at first known as the finest
    in the Kanto District, then grandest in Japan with the
    progress of the construction work, and recently it is called
    one of the most unique places in the world. There are many
    noted religious architectures in the world, like, the
    Parthenon in Greece, Vatican in Rome, Westminster Abbey in
    England, etc.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As non-religious architecture, Peking Castle is
    noted for its vast scale and the magnificence of its
    architectural beauty. In Japan, Toshogu at Nikko will be the
    only place which we can boast of as such. Compared with the
    places mentioned above, the amount of money which was used in
    building Zuiunkyo or Atami Earthly Paradise will be
    relatively small.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">However, in regards to the location on which it
    is built, its completeness, the beautiful scenery around it
    or commanded from it, it will have no equal in the world.
    Many architectural specialists have praised it unanimously
    from this viewpoint.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">First its natural environment. The hill on which
    it stands is only about one hundred meters above sea level.
    And it is easily accessible.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Messianic Hall which is situated on the site
    which is higher, is 108 feet wide and 120 feet deep and its
    floor space is about 35,604 square feet. I have planned it on
    a newer architectural style based on that of Le Corbusier,
    famous French architect. The design is very simple.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Interesting enough, this Le Corbusier style was
    born, I hear, from a hint taken from the architectural style
    of a Japanese tea house. At one side of this building there
    is a stone wall of about 24 feet high and about 300 feet long.
    This stone wall alone is astonishing in its magnitude.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Only God could prepare such line of beauty of
    the undulating hills which surround the hall. Looked as a
    whole from the foot of the hill, one will be so fascinated by
    the beauty that one may forget that one is in this world.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Besides, one hundred old plum trees, one hundred
    Cherry trees, which originated in Yoshino, Kyoto, fifty
    cherry trees bearing double blossoms, less than one hundred
    large azaleas, and chinchoges or daphne odoras, lilacs,
    wistarias, yellow roses, camellias, tulips, hyacinth,
    daffodils, chrysanthemum coronariums, anemones, pansies,
    carnations, and cyclamens, etc., all spring flowering plants
    will be planted. So when it is completed, its beauty will be
    beyond imagination and incomparable. Above is the first part
    of the construction work. When the second and third parts of
    the construction work have been completed, I believe that
    this Model Earthly Paradise will become an internationally
    noted place. Then for all the visitors from abroad, visiting
    this place will be a must, with that of the Toshogu in Nikko.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Finally, the purpose of constructing such
    building is to create a work of art which is a combination of
    art and the beauty of nature of Japan. For that purpose,
    choice of position is most important. Therefore, I traveled
    all over Japan before I made my decision. As a result, I
    found that Atami is an ideal place, where the climate is very
    mild, and which is full of variety with hotsprings,
    mountains, sea, islands (Hatsu-shima Island and Ohshima
    Island) and a winding coast-line.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Besides it is situated between the Kansai
    District and Kanto District. This makes the place easy of
    access. It also adjoins Hakone and Izu Penninsula, two
    national parks. Thus it may be said to have been chosen by
    divine guidance. I was able to purchase the most beautiful
    place in Atami which amounts to 30,000 tsubo. Thus every
    condition to build the model of the Earthly Paradise in Atami
    may be said to have been prepared earlier</font><font

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I am firmly convinced that the building of the
    Hakone Art Museum, was achieved by something more than merely
    human power. The speed with which it was built and the
    quickness with which art objects owned by it have been
    gathered have no precedent. Such speed is so remarkable that
    it could be called a divine skill. Private museums in this
    country have been completed by millionaire virtuosos after
    efforts of a whole lifetime, although I do not know if it is
    the same in foreign countries.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The Hakone Art Museum has been completed,
    however, only in several years since it was first planned.
    The money necessary came as donations from our followers, and
    the art objects owned by the museum have been collected after
    World War II or borrowed, not particularly being sought for
    by us for the definite purpose of establishing the Hakone Art
    Museum. The only way of construction has been to trust in
    God's skill. The same thing can be said of the variety of the
    kinds of the art objects.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I was able to purchase art objects which I was
    anxious to get for considerably cheap prices and also some of
    them were donated by followers. Thus art objects enough to be
    exhibited in the museum have been collected quite smoothly
    and naturally. Everything went so well that it was as if God
    had a hand in the work.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I have also collected ancient art objects of
    Egypt, Greece, Persia, India and old China etc. so abundantly
    that they can hardly all be exhibited at one time. I have
    never dreamed of collecting these. I have not even known the
    ancient art of the West. However, those subjects began to
    come in one after another this year. I was very happy that
    they have been collected. By and by I have perceived their
    charm and so I was struck by the divine intention working in
    the collection of those ancient art objects of Western
    countries. The Art Museum took the initiative in collecting
    them because they have never been collected by other museums
    in Japan including the National Museum.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">When I visted the Ukiyo-e Exhibition held by the
    Kyoto Museum of Art last year, I perceived that Ukiyo-e, in
    which I had not been previously much interested, was
    wonderful and then I was introduced a Dr. Ichitaro Kondo,
    famous scholar of Ukiyo-e who was kind enough to explain
    about Ukiyo-e to me. This contributed to my getting a general
    idea of Ukiyo-e. Later my knowledge on Ukiyo-e was increased.
    Then, excellent masterpieces of Ukiyo-e which were hitherto
    hard to obtain, began to pour in without asking. This assured
    me of the Divine Will. The main building of the museum had
    not enough space for another exhibition, so I planned a wing
    and held an Ukiyo-e exhibition. The wing after its completion
    enhanced the beauty of the museum.<br>

    face="Arial">Basic account will be given here of why I have
    established an art museum on the hill of Hakone in Shizuoka
    Prefecture, a well-known tourist point in Japan.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As is usually stated, the primary object of
    World Messianity is to create a world in which truth, virtue
    and beauty are united in perfect harmony. The museum
    symbolizes beauty of the three. It is, so to speak, an
    unprecedented work of art in which natural and man made
    beauty are united to the utmost.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Japan possesses many fine works of art as do
    other countries in the world. However, such works of art have
    so far been in the hands of the privileged classes and not
    displayed to the general public. They have been shown only to
    a limited few. In other words, it is the monopolization of
    art, representing a feudalistic trend of thinking to which
    Japanese have ever adhered.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Regretting this matter, I planned to break down
    this evil and socialize art. In short, I desired to
    emancipate art and give it life.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Fortunately, my long-cherished desire has
    materialized earlier than expected as a result of earnest
    cooperation of my religious followers.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There are many private art museums throughout
    the country, but their original intention far differed from
    mine. These private museums have been brought into
    incorporated bodies by millionaires or financial cliques who
    wish to maintain and safeguard a number of works of art which
    they have collected, regardless of expenses, merely to
    satisfy their taste, protect their property and attain their
    aspiration after fame. The art galleries are perfunctorily
    opened for a short period twice in spring and autumn in
    accordance with the regulations providing that they must be
    exhibited to the public for a fixed number of days a year.
    Accordingly, it must be said that their social significance
    is very remote.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Contrarily, our museum at Hakone is always
    opened to the public except for the three months of December,
    January and February, in which it is closed because of bad
    weather.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Even from this viewpoint, the Hakone museum is
    idealistic. Furthermore, there are many rare and well-known
    works of art being displayed in it, which it is sure to give
    great satisfaction to those who are interested in art. I have
    purposely kept the admission as low as possible. The museum
    will render great service even in social welfare.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">National museums are not so useful to those
    studying contemporary art. since they are, for the most part,
    occupied by historical and archaeological works of art.
    Private museums in this country mostly constitute works of
    Chinese and Western art. In this sense, there have been no
    museums characteristic of Japanese art in this country before
    the completion of our gallery at Hakone. The Hakone Museum,
    therefore, will contribute greatly even from the viewpoint of
    preserving valuable cultural assets.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It has been remarked by President Asano of the
    National Museum at Ueno, and Chief Fujikawa of the General
    Affairs Bureau of the Cultural Properties Protection
    Commission that such a museum as ours is meeting the demands
    of the State perfectly. They also stated that they wished me
    to give my full efforts to the work, as they greatly favoured
    it.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The prospect that foreign tourists visiting
    Japan will drop in at the Hakone Museum, is very gratifying.
    Even from this viewpoint, the museum will not a little
    contribute toward enhancing the status of Japanese culture in
    the world. Beginning with Dr. Warner, many noted foreigners
    have already visited the Hakone museum.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I am confident that the day will not be distant
    when the museum will become internationally known and counted
    as one of the features of Japan.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Followers of Wold Messianity well know that the
    purpose of God is to create an ideal world where truth,
    virtue and beauty dominate. And, the purpose of Satan is,
    needless to say, to foster falsehood, vice and ugliness.
    &quot;Falsehood&quot; and &quot;vice&quot; may be understood,
    but &quot;ugliness&quot; may need explaining.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">One mistake has been passing current with the
    world, that is, people have been apt to accept ugliness when
    it goes hand in hand with truth and virtue. Indeed, there
    have been noble persons who have practised virtue for people
    and society, being content with coarse clothing, simple
    foods, humble dwellings, thus leading a life of utter
    simplicity. Should they be forced by circumstances to live
    thus, it can not be helped, but if not, and they still like
    to lead such a plain life it is not good.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Many religionists have led ascetic lives as a
    form of self-discipline. Such way of life has been deemed
    respectable by themselves and also by people in general. This
    way of thinking is however, erroneous. An important element
    of beauty is neglected and so, such a life is dominated by
    truth, virtue and ugliness. In such a sense, man's food,
    clothing and habitation should be as attractive and
    comfortable as possible so far as within his means. God
    approves such way of living. Beauty which not only satisfies
    oneself but gives pleasure to others may be looked upon as a
    kind of virtue.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The higher the civilization of a society the
    more it is conscious of the value of beauty. For example,
    there is scarcely a trace of beauty in the life of barbarians.
    So that we can say that progress of culture means at the same
    time progress of appreciation of beauty. As to individuals,
    even men should try to attain beauty enough to give a
    pleasure to others. It goes without saying that woman should
    try to become as beautiful as possible.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As for the home, beauty and orderliness should
    herein be stressed together with cleanliness. Not only the
    families living in such homes, but also guests will reel
    comfortable. Especially the latter will involuntarily feel
    respect towards the master of the home.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The exterior of a house, if it is kept clean and
    in good repair, will give a sense of pleasure to passers-by.
    I believe that Switzerland gives great pleasure to foreigners
    as her cities and parks are so lovely and clean. The very
    reason that visitors to that country are so impressed, should
    be an object lesson in itself.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">We Japanese should cultivate more aesthetic
    sense of values. As a result, not only individuals, but also
    this country as a whole will unexpectedly benefit by it.
    Besides, beautiful environment makes for better social
    morals, and places man's mind on a higher plane, and this in
    turn helps to reduce crime and evil in society. Such
    phenomena will much contribute to realize the Earthly
    Paradise.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As for myself, I have liked anything concerned
    with beauty, and even whilst suffering from poverty, I used
    to make a small flower bed in my garden, paint, try to visit
    museums and exhibitions as often as possible, enjoy flowers
    in spring and the crimson foliage in autumn. Now I have
    become able enough through God's favour, to enjoy beauty at
    will, and this in turn contributes to the Divine Program.
    Those who are ignorant of this may criticize my life as being
    too extravagant, but this can not be helped. Compared with
    the founders of religions since olden days who spread their
    teachings while leading humble and penitent lives my mode of
    living may seem to be peculiar. Religionists used to spread
    their teachings while they themselves lived in hellish

    </strong></font><font size="3" face="Arial"></font></p>
    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">As I have previously stated, I have been
    interested in art since my younger days.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">During the pre-war days, I was merely a student
    spectator and enjoyed viewing various works of art. To speak
    more frankly, there was no choice for me but to be satisfied
    only in visiting museums, art exhibitions or art shows in
    department stores, because of lack of funds.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">After World War II, however, I managed to obtain
    possession of a number of works of art, at relatively low
    cost. But, what I purchased was limited to a specialized sort
    of works, for at that time I did not have sufficient
    knowledge in other fields of art. My pieces included drawings
    by Korin and Sotatsu, one-time famous artists in Japan,
    earthenware by also one-time well-known potters in Japan
    including Ninsei, Kanzan and Nabeshima, and picture scrolls.
    As to picture scrolls, I had once studied this work myself
    when I was young.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Thus, with my collection increasing, an idea
    came across my mind that if a world of truth, virtue and
    beauty, that is, the earthly paradise, which is advocated by
    World Messianity is to be created, beauty would be essential.
    Though truth and virtue are each of spiritual elements,
    beauty is material. If the beauty is to be displayed
    concretely, not only natural beauty but also man-made beauty
    will have to go with it. The best way to attain this is to
    set up an art museum.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Fortunately, as soon as I moved to Hakone in the
    spring of 1944, I found a suitable place nearby and bought it.
    Shortly after, I chanced to find a very nice place in Atami
    and secured it, also. Thus, with the securing of space, has
    developed the conception as is seen at the present. This
    evidences the profound plan of God which is shaping step by
    step. The art museum, whose completion is a God-given task
    has received its finishing touch.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In this connection, I will disclose a very
    interesting story. As stated earlier, I had no knowledge of
    art except for a specialized kind of works. However, God
    opened my eyes and increased my thirst for further knowledge.
    In the first one or two years, I got various pictorial
    records concerning drawings by the Korin school and works by
    potters including Ninsei, Kanzan and Nabeshima, at the same
    time, I had opportunities to hear experts explain them. When
    I managed to understand the substance of the works, I went
    into the study of modern pictures, the Yamato-e painting, a
    picture representing things Japanese, or the Ukiyo-e, a genre
    picture in the following year, then into the Higashiyama
    brush painting in ink (sumi), old brush writing or the
    pictures painted in Sung and Yuan Dynasties in China the next
    year, followed by potteries of China and Korea and Buddhist
    painting during the last year. With the coming of the new
    year, I chanced to obtain various bibliographies and
    pictorial records relating to Buddhist images. Meanwhile, I
    have had chances to get even Buddhist statues shown.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">According to my experiences up to the present,
    it has taken me about one year to finish studying each field
    of art.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Such being the case, the works of art to be
    displayed at the Hakone Museum will run over various fields
    of art. I believe such an exhibition will be the first of its
    kind in Japan.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It comes as a surprise that there are no other
    art museums peculiar to Japan in this country. This is
    evident upon visiting other museums now existing in Japan. In
    the national museums, for instance, Buddhist art is surely
    worth seeing, but other fields of art to speak without
    reserve, are very poor. Even the Bridgestone Museum recently
    established in Japan is nothing but an art hall to represent
    Western paintings. The Okura Shuko Hall exists only for
    Chinese art, the Nezu Museum for pottery and Chinese
    copperware, the Kyoto Museum for temple art, the Sumitomo Art
    Gallery for Chinese copperware, the Hakutsuru Museum in Osaka
    for Chinese earthenware and copperware, and the Ohara Art
    Hall in Okayama for Western art.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">It is indeed a matter of regret that we who are
    Japanese can not enjoy any works of art peculiar to Japan in
    our own country. From this viewpoint, I intend through the
    Hakone Museum to concentrate my energies upon Japanese art
    and give satisfaction to all. Though the museum is not large
    in scale yet, it will be sure to make those who visit it
    experience every satisfaction with art of Japan and, at the
    same time, be a source of interest to foreign visitors.<br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I should like all Japanese to realize the trait
    of their own national character, which had they previously
    known, their country would not have been plunged into war,
    nor would they have suffered such a miserable defeat. Just as
    self recognition is important to every individual, Japanese
    should know what Japan is. It is very necessary to know one's
    own country, as now is not the time of national isolation,
    but the time in which everything which occurs is
    international and world-wide in character and mutual relation.
    It is necessary to know what role this country should play.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The definite line on which this country should
    proceed can not be established unless the Japanese realize
    the raison d'etre of their own country. Until the end of
    World War II, a privileged military class formed a
    dictatorship, and an arbitrary regime was formed under the
    minority. The Japanese people had no voice against the men of
    power, and were enslaved. This is still fresh in our memory.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Since the Meiji Era, National Constitution and a
    representative system had been established and the will of
    the people was apparently respected, but in reality, the
    reins of power were held by a minority who led the people to
    war. This was like the case of crying wine and selling
    vinegar.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">To review Japanese history. There have been
    constant internal disturbances in this country since the
    regime of Emperor Jimmu, the first emperor of Japan, and the
    government had been utterly controlled by the sword. An
    individual who showed skill in fighting was empowered in the
    name of chivalry, and the conqueror in war became supreme
    ruler of the time. Japan until the end of the war had been
    led by such historical current in which violence ruled. The
    great shock of defeat in World War II stopped the current.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The true line which Japan should take as a
    country of peace will not be established until all Japanese
    perceive deeply the significance of such Japanese history.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">An important thing to stress again, is the true
    character of Japan. The character of Japan should be a
    country of peace in which art flourishes, altogether contrary
    to the role she had taken as a country of feudalism and
    militarism. Herein lies the mission which has been endowed
    Japan by God. Therefore, the reconstruction of this country
    which is so frequently talked about is nothing, if it does
    not allude to an entirely new Japan in character.
    Reconstructed Japan as popularly spoken about, will merely be
    a democratic shell without preparedness. To an extent this
    may be all right, but the Japanese people should perceive
    more clearly the special role of their country in the world,
    and by doing so, try to contribute to the welfare of all the
    people of the world. This is the true role which new Japan
    should play. Let us go deeper into this.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Most foreigners who visit this country praise
    her scenery which is of uncomparable excellence. The fact
    that Japan's climate is very distinctly divided into four
    seasons has a deep meaning. This causes distinct relative
    changes in her scenery. Mr. Kyoshi Takahama, a famous poet
    composer of seventeen syllable verse (Haiku), following his
    world tour, stated that no other country he visited had so
    clearly defined four seasonal changes, and as a true
    seventeen syllable poem applies to the seasons, it was
    difficult to compose such true verse for other countries.
    Japan is further rich in the variety of vegetation, flowers,
    fish and shells.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Another remarkable thing is that the Japanese
    people are dexterous in the use of their hands, and therefore
    have an aptitude for fine art and industrial art. It is
    extremely astonishing that there are so many fine masterpiece
    of art to be found in this country although they were created
    during a history of incessant internal troubles.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">In short, the whole land of Japan should be
    turned into a vast national park in the broad sense of
    speaking, and art in this country should be improved to the
    highest possible standard in order for Japan to fulfil her
    mission.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">Her national policy should be the undertaking of
    the tourist trade and improvement of art and industrial art.
    As a result, Japan will not only be able to contribute to the
    improvement of ideas of all the peoples of the world, but
    also give refreshing pleasure and solace. Japan should try to
    attain the highest state of civilization and develop the
    highest form of arts.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">At the present, all the people of the world feel
    most keenly the fear of war. The root cause of war is the
    strife consciousness which is deep-rooted in man's mind. This
    strife consciousness being born of barbarism, modern people
    have not cast off the surface of barbarism, although they
    like to advocate civilization. The way to rid people of this
    strife consciousness is to change their direction to an
    interest in art. In other words, redirect the progress of the
    world of strife to a peaceful world of art.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">World peace enforced by the power of the sword
    is not lasting. It should fundamentally be realized through a
    revolution of idea which can only be performed through
    religion and art.<br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">The reconstruction of Japan should be the
    reconstruction of a new Japan in which art predominates.<br>
