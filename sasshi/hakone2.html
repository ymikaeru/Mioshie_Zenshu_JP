    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">I am Mokichi Okada, the founder of the World
    Messianity. I express hereby my heartfelt thanks for your
    visiting this art museum today. Seizing this opportunity, I
    would like to explain my motive of establishing this museum.
    Any of your criticism or suggestion on this museum or objects
    of fine art exhibited are most eagerly welcomed.</font><font
    size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">The fundamental
    ideal of religion is to create a world full of truth, virtue
    and beauty. Truth and virtue are metaphysical, while beauty
    can actually be shown in form, and it improves the human soul
    through eyes. It is well known how flourishing the religious
    art was in the time from Greek and Roman periods down to the
    mediaeval ages in Europe, and also from the reign of Prince
    Shotoku to the Kamakura Era in Japan. In those times, almost
    all of the aesthetic works of men, such as pictures,
    engravings and musics, were based upon religion.</font><font
    size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Nowadays, however,
    such tendency as above has become unrecognizable, and art has
    been separated from religion. The most important cause of
    this separation may be attributed to the fact that the
    religion has been left behind the human progress. Religious
    activities in every country have become dormant, making a
    good contrast with the dazzling exploits of the modern
    science. For myself, I believe that religion and art should
    make progress assisting each other just like two wheels of a
    cart.</font><font size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Here I would like to
    mention the most conspicuous characteristics of the Japanese
    people. Every country on the globe, like human individuals,
    has its own thought and culture. The national characteristics
    of the Japanese people is to give delight to the people of
    the world by means of beauty and thus to contribute to the
    development of culture. This is easily understood when we
    think of the excellent beauty of landscapes and the numerous
    varieties of flowers and plants in Japan as well as the keen
    sense of the people for beauty and their excellency in
    handiworks.</font><font size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">Nevertheless, Japan
    who was not aware of her fundamental mission had committed
    such a fatal error as to wage war and subsequently had to see
    the grief of defeat. I believe that it was the merciful
    providence of the Deity that He awakened Japan to her mission
    through the defeat. Moreover, the Deity has deprived Japan of
    her weapons. Though the problem of rearmament has recently
    been being discussed, it should strictly be confined within
    the scope of national defence; it should have no further
    meaning. <br>
    <br>
    </font><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">From the above viewpoint, the future course of
    Japan is self-evident. I believe that the eternal peace and
    prosperity will be brought about if we adhere to the above
    ideal, and I am conducting myself with such belief. I have
    first planned to construct a miniature paradise full of
    beauty and show it to the public in order to realize my ideal.
    The places to meet with the conditions are found in Hakone
    and Atami which are faultless having good climate, fresh air
    and hot-springs in addition to convenient transportation and
    beautiful landscapes. Therefore, I decided to construct
    heavenly gardens first in these two places, incorporating
    natural and artificial beauties into one. I have recently
    completed the construction of this Hakone Miniature Paradise,
    including the art gallery.</font><font size="3"><br>

    <p class="honbun"><font size="3">　　</font><font size="3"
    face="Arial">There have hitherto been scarcely any pure
    Japanese art museums in Japan, as you know. Those having
    existed are Chinese and Occidental art museums, or else we
    see only the art of religious import in a museum. Thus, the
    Japanese people themselves have not had chance to appreciate
    the Japanese art, to say nothing of foreigners visiting Japan
    with a desire to see the genuine Japanese art; there has been
    no such facility or way as to satisfy their demand. Is this
    not a great negligence on the part of Japan as an artistic
    country? Therefore, if this art museum newly opened has
    something to make up for the defect, it is a greatest
    pleasure for me.</font><font size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">I have never been
    abroad. As a result of my survey, however, I have found that
    most of the Japanese arts abroad are prints, and there are
    scarcely any masterpieces of Japanese paintings. Americans
    and Europeans have highly appreciated the Chinese art, and it
    is said that good collections of Chinese pottery and copper-wares
    are seen abroad. But Chinese pictures of the first quality
    have not been transferred to the United States or Europe. In
    China excellent pictures were produced in Sung and Yuan
    periods, but these were burnt out in the frequent wars. Most
    of them have not remained in the original land of China. A
    large part of the existing ones are those collected in Japan
    at the time of Ashikaga-Yoshimitsu and Yoshimasa (about 500
    years ago) and succeeded by Oda-Nobunaga and Toyotomi-Hideyoshi
    (about 360 years ago).</font><font size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">As for Chinese
    pottery and copper-wares, many of them were buried in war-time
    for protection from the havocs of war. Therefore, most of the
    existing wares are the one which had been dug out of the
    ground, and there are very few flawless ones, some cracks
    being made which digging and others in the elapse of
    thousands of years. In this museum there is a crock of
    Anderson which is said to have been produced 4,000 years ago.
    It is so fine that we wonder how such a wonderful art could
    have been produced at that time. Generally speaking, we can
    find excellent potteries among those produced in the time of
    Riu-Chao and Tang period (220-900) and besides, there are
    good ones in the Sung period (1,000), when the production of
    celadon porcelain was lively, as is well known. As regards
    copper-wares, good works were produced directly before or
    after Chou period (about 3,000 years ago). It was in Nara
    Period in Japan (about 1,200 years ago) that such works as
    above mentioned were first imported to Japan. That is why the
    Chinese potteries in Japan are very beautiful, though once
    buried wares. In this meaning, it is no exaggeration to say
    that Japan has preserved most of the Chinese art.</font><font
    size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">In addition, it must
    be noted that since old time Japan has had her own fine works
    of art which are truly worthy to be proud of to the world.
    Nevertheless, they were kept in the sequestered places of
    aristocrats' or millionaires' houses up to the end of the
    World War II, and were not exhibited to the public. This
    might have been due partly to the exclusive and conservative
    minds of the feudal age. But now it is only an anachronism
    for us living in the democratic age. The original raison
    d'etre of the objects of art can be said to lie in the fact
    that they are shown to as many people as possible to give
    them delight and improve unnoticed the human nature. If so,
    the most important thing is to break the exclusive thought
    and to show them to the public. Hence, I have long desired to
    show the objects of art of the international level to
    foreigners and, at the same time, to the Japanese public so
    that they could enjoy them. I have also wished to accord
    facilities to artists who cannot have chances to see the
    Japanese art of supreme quality for their study. Fortunately
    many aesthetic objects which had been kept under lock and key
    were issued to the market at the time of the national reform
    after the war, and these contributed very much to the
    enrichment of this art museum.</font><font size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">This art museum was
    planned all by myself, and though its scale is small, I have
    done it with the idea to construct a model for many art
    museums to be established in and out of the country in future.
    I have also planned the garden paying attention to the
    minutest details of one tree and plant in it. Of course there
    may be many defects in the plan made by an amateur like me.
    But if it serves somehow as a good model, I shall be
    satisfied. Besides, sufficient consideration was paid to the
    circumstances, facilities, etc., in order to protect these
    masterpieces of fine art from air-raids, fires and thefts
    which may occur in future. Therefore, my scheme will also
    contribute to the preservation of national treasures.</font><font
    size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">As it has been
    explained above, I have no other intention than to realize my
    ideal of constructing a country of beauty or a paradise,
    which should be the true phase of Japan.</font><font size="3"><br>
    <br>
    　　</font><font size="3" face="Arial">I am planning to
    construct other miniature paradises including art galleries
    at Atami and Kyoto in the near future. Your support to my
    plan in future will be greatly appreciated.</font><font
